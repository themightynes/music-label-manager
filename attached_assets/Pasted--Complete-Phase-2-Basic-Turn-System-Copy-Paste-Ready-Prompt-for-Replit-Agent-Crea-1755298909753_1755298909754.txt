# Complete Phase 2: Basic Turn System

## üéØ **Copy-Paste Ready Prompt for Replit Agent:**

```
Create the core turn-based game system with a premium music industry dashboard aesthetic. Build this in 3 incremental steps:

STEP 1: EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD
Create the main game dashboard with music industry executive styling:

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- Header: "üéµ Music Label Manager" with current month display and settings icon
- 4 main metric cards in responsive grid:
  * Finances Card: Current money, monthly burn rate with trend indicator
  * Reputation Card: Global percentage, USA regional breakdown  
  * Artists Card: Signed artists with mood/loyalty star ratings
  * Focus Slots Card: Available vs used slots with visual progress
- Right sidebar: Access Tiers showing playlist/press/venue badges (all "None" initially)

VISUAL THEME - Music Industry Executive:
- Dark theme: Background #0f0f0f, cards #1a1a1a, borders #333333
- Gold accents #ffd700 for active states and highlights
- Card hover effects: subtle gold glow on borders
- Icons: üí∞ (finances), üìà (reputation), üé§ (artists), ‚ö° (focus), üéØ (access)
- Typography: Clean sans-serif, white primary text, #b3b3b3 secondary text

COMPONENT PATTERNS TO USE:
```jsx
const MetricCard = ({ title, value, subtitle, icon }) => (
  <div className="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-4 hover:border-yellow-500 transition-colors">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
      <div>
        <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm">{title}</p>
        <p className="text-white text-xl font-bold">{value}</p>
        {subtitle && <p className="text-gray-500 text-xs">{subtitle}</p>}
      </div>
      <div className="text-yellow-500 text-2xl">{icon}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

STEP 2: MONTH PLANNER INTERFACE
Create the action selection screen with ‚Äúbattle card‚Äù style:

LAYOUT:

- Page title: ‚ÄúüìÖ Month Planner - Select up to 3 Focus Actions‚Äù
- Industry Meetings section showing all 8 roles from roles.json as selectable cards
- Each role card shows: name, relationship level (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ), preview quote from first meeting
- Projects section: ‚ÄúRecord Single‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlan EP‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlan Mini-Tour‚Äù cards
- Selected actions bar at bottom showing chosen actions
- Large ‚ÄúüöÄ ADVANCE MONTH‚Äù button

ROLE CARD PATTERN:

```jsx
const RoleCard = ({ role, selected, onToggle, disabled }) => (
  <div 
    className={`border-2 rounded-lg p-4 cursor-pointer transition-all ${
      selected 
        ? 'border-yellow-500 bg-yellow-500/10 shadow-lg shadow-yellow-500/20' 
        : 'border-gray-600 hover:border-gray-400'
    } ${disabled ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed' : ''}`}
    onClick={!disabled ? onToggle : undefined}
  >
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
      <input type="checkbox" checked={selected} readOnly className="text-yellow-500" />
      <div className="flex-1">
        <h3 className="text-white font-semibold">{role.name}</h3>
        <div className="text-yellow-500 text-sm">{"‚òÖ".repeat(Math.floor(role.relationship/20))}</div>
        <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm italic">"{role.meetings[0]?.prompt?.slice(0, 40)}..."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

STEP 3: MONTH ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM
Implement the turn resolution with professional feedback:

BACKEND LOGIC:

- POST /api/advance-month endpoint that:
  - Increments month number
  - Applies monthly burn from balance.json ($3-6k range)
  - Processes selected role meetings (mark as completed, apply immediate effects)
  - Returns detailed summary of what happened
- GET /api/game-state endpoint returning current state
- POST /api/select-actions endpoint to save player choices

ADVANCEMENT SUMMARY MODAL:

- Show professional summary with sections:
  - ‚ÄúMonth 2 - Summary Report‚Äù
  - Financial changes with icons and explanations
  - Relationship changes from meetings
  - New opportunities unlocked
  - Next month preview
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Close button returns to dashboard with updated state

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Use game data from uploaded JSON files (roles.json, balance.json, world.json)
- Store game state in database (month, money, reputation, selectedActions)
- Apply seeded RNG for money variance (0.9-1.1 multiplier)
- Validate action selection limits (max 3 focus slots)
- Reset action selections after month advancement

GAME STATE INITIALIZATION:

- Starting values from world.json: $75k money, Month 1, 5% global reputation, 3 focus slots
- Load all 8 roles with relationship starting at 50%
- Artists loaded from artists.json with starting mood/loyalty

Make this feel like a premium music industry management tool with smooth interactions, clear feedback, and professional visual design. The player should feel like a connected label executive making strategic decisions.
