Build a browser-based music industry simulation game called "Music Label Manager" where players run their own record label through monthly turns over a 12-month campaign.

CORE GAMEPLAY:
- Monthly turn-based progression with 3 focus slots per month
- Sign and develop artists across 3 archetypes (Visionary, Workhorse, Trendsetter)  
- Manage 8 key industry relationships (Manager, A&R, Producer, PR, Digital Marketing, Streaming, Booking, Operations)
- Create and release Singles, EPs, and Mini-Tours
- Build reputation and access tiers (playlist/press/venue access)
- Respond to industry side events and make strategic choices

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Express backend with PostgreSQL database
- Monthly turn resolution system with resource management
- Dialogue system with immediate + delayed effects  
- Chart/sales tracking with visual feedback
- Save system with multiple slots

GAME SYSTEMS NEEDED:
1. Turn Management: Monthly progression with action selection
2. Resource Management: Money, Reputation, Creative Capital, Artist stats
3. Dialogue System: Role meetings with 3-4 choice options showing immediate effects
4. Project System: Track Singles/EPs/Tours with quality, cost, timeline
5. Market Simulation: Sales based on quality + access + reputation + marketing
6. Access Progression: Unlock playlist/press/venue tiers based on achievements
7. Event System: Random monthly events with player choices
8. Artist Development: Mood, loyalty, popularity progression by region

I have comprehensive game data files ready to upload including:
- Complete balance configuration with formulas and difficulty settings
- 8 roles Ã— 3 meetings = 24 dialogue scenes with branching choices  
- 3 artist archetypes with personality-driven dialogue trees
- 12 side story events with consequences
- Full database schema with all entities and relationships
- Validation schemas and seeding scripts

Build this as a single integrated application using modern web technologies with the game data I'll provide driving all content and balance.
