● ✅ 12-Month Campaign Completion System Implemented

  I've successfully implemented a comprehensive 12-month campaign completion system:

  ✅ What Was Implemented

  1. Campaign Completion Logic in GameEngine
    - Added checkCampaignCompletion() method that triggers at month 12
    - Campaign stops advancing after completion
    - Comprehensive scoring system based on money, reputation, and access tiers
  2. Victory Conditions & Scoring
    - 5 Victory Types: Commercial Success, Critical Acclaim, Balanced Growth, Survival, Failure
    - Score Categories: Money (1pt/$1k), Reputation (1pt/5rep), Access Tier Bonuses
    - Dynamic Achievements: Unlocked based on performance thresholds
  3. Database Schema Updated
    - Added campaignCompleted boolean field to gameStates table
    - Database migration applied successfully
    - API contracts updated to include campaign results
  4. Professional Campaign Results UI
    - Created CampaignResultsModal component with victory type icons
    - Score breakdown visualization
    - Achievement display with narrative summary
    - "Start New Campaign" functionality
  5. Server-Side Integration
    - API endpoints return campaign results when month 12 is reached
    - Prevents further month advancement after completion
    - Proper error handling for completed campaigns

  🎯 Game Flow Now Works As Intended

  - Months 1-11: Normal gameplay progression
  - Month 12: Final month with campaign completion
  - Post-Campaign: Shows results modal, prevents further advancement
  - New Game: Players can start fresh campaigns

  🏆 Victory Types Implemented

  - 💰 Commercial Success: Focus on profit and business growth
  - ⭐ Critical Acclaim: Focus on reputation and industry respect
  - 🏆 Balanced Growth: Excellence in both areas
  - 🛡️ Survival: Made it through 12 months
  - 💔 Failure: Bankruptcy or very low performance

  The 12-month structure is now properly implemented. Players at Month 13+ will complete their campaign and see
  final results, then can start new games. Ready to proceed with the 4 integration tasks from MVP_STATUS?
