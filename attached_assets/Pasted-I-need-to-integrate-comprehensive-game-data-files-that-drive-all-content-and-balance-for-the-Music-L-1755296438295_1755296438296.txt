I need to integrate comprehensive game data files that drive all content and balance for the Music Label Manager simulation. I'm uploading 6 JSON files that contain all the game's content, balance formulas, and configuration.

WHAT TO CREATE:

1. CREATE /data folder in root directory with these uploaded files:
   - artists.json (3 artist archetypes with stats and dialogue)
   - balance.json (complete economy, formulas, difficulty settings)
   - dialogue.json (additional artist conversation scenes)
   - events.json (12 side story events with choices)
   - roles.json (8 industry roles with 3 meetings each = 24 total scenes)
   - world.json (game world configuration and settings)

2. CREATE /shared/types/gameTypes.ts with TypeScript interfaces for:
   - Artist type with archetype, stats (talent, workEthic, popularity, etc.)
   - Role type with relationship, meetings, choices
   - Event type with choices and effects
   - GameState type with money, reputation, month, focusSlots
   - Choice type with immediate and delayed effects
   - Project type for Singles, EPs, Tours

3. CREATE /shared/utils/dataLoader.ts with functions to:
   - Load and validate all JSON files
   - Parse balance configuration
   - Get role meetings by roleId
   - Get artist dialogue by archetype
   - Get random events from pool

4. CREATE /server/data/gameData.ts that:
   - Imports all JSON files
   - Exports typed data objects
   - Validates data structure on startup

5. UPDATE /server/db.ts to include game state tables:
   - gameStates (id, month, money, reputation, focusSlots, artistIds)
   - artists (id, name, archetype, signed, stats, mood, loyalty)
   - projects (id, type, status, quality, cost, artistId)
   - meetings (id, roleId, sceneId, choiceId, month)

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

- All JSON files should be imported and accessible via clean API
- Type all data using the interfaces from the uploaded files
- Create helper functions to get role meetings, artist data, events
- Validate data structure matches the uploaded schemas
- Add error handling for missing or malformed data
- Export everything in a clean, organized way for the game systems

The uploaded files contain:
- Complete balance formulas and economic settings
- 8 roles Ã— 3 meetings = 24 dialogue scenes with branching choices
- 3 artist archetypes with personality-driven stats
- 12 side story events with consequences
- Full game world configuration
