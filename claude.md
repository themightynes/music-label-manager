# Music Label Manager - Claude Session Instructions

## üìä Project Architecture Overview
TypeScript monorepo with Express backend and React frontend for a music industry simulation game.

**Stack**: React 18 + Vite, Wouter routing, TanStack Query, Clerk auth, Zustand state, XState flows, Motion.dev animations, Express + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL

**Key Components**:
- Monorepo with coordinated npm scripts (`dev`, `build`, `db:push`)
- Shared game state via Zustand store with API sync
- Complex meeting flows modeled with XState state machines
- Drizzle schemas define gameplay domain (users, saves, artists, songs, releases, charts, labels)
- GameEngine processes weekly actions and financial systems (shared client/server)
- Shared Zod contracts keep API schemas in sync

## üö® Railway Deployment Environment
**Critical for Railway PostgreSQL sessions:**
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL with standard `pg` driver (migrated from Neon serverless)
- **Connection**: Uses `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with SSL enabled
- **Pool Settings**: Max 10 connections, 30s idle timeout, 10s connection timeout
- **SSL Config**: `rejectUnauthorized: false` required for Railway's certificates
- **Local Development**: Default port 5000 for main application
- **Alternative ports**: Use ports like 3000, 8000, or 8080 for testing servers

## üìã Special Implementation Notes
- Must preserve `/data/` JSON files - these are the game's content source
- All JSON data must validate with Zod schemas
- Use small, incremental changes: Plan ‚Üí Propose ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Verify

## üé® Color System
- **Brand Colors**: Use `brand-*` Tailwind classes for game-specific UI (e.g., `bg-brand-burgundy`, `text-brand-rose`)
- **Semantic Colors**: Use semantic classes for generic UI (e.g., `bg-success`, `text-warning`, `bg-sidebar`)
- **Documentation**: See the comprehensive color system documentation in `tailwind.config.ts` header comments
- **Tier Badges**: Bronze (amber), Silver (gray), Gold (brand-gold), Platinum (purple)
- **Never use inline hex colors** - all colors must use Tailwind utility classes

## üîê Authentication & API Integration
- Authentication is powered by Clerk; rely on Clerk React hooks and components (`useUser()`, `useAuth()`, `<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>`, `<UserButton>`)
- Never roll your own auth helpers‚Äîextend behavior by composing Clerk primitives and reference Clerk documentation for additional components
- When calling backend endpoints, always go through the shared `apiRequest()` helper in `queryClient.ts`; it attaches Clerk JWT tokens automatically and prevents duplicate auth logic

## ‚úÖ Validation Commands
- `npm run check` - Run TypeScript compilation check
- `npm run dev` - Starts both client and server with hot reload
- `pkill -f "tsx server"` - Clean up any lingering server processes

## XState & Stately Runtime Notes
- `xstate` drives multi-step decision flows; prefer typed machine definitions and actor logic over ad-hoc reducer state.
- Co-locate machines with the feature they support and share cross-tier contracts through `shared/` when both client and server dispatch the same events.
- Attach `@statelyai/inspect` only in dev contexts (e.g., guard with `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` or `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`) so visualization tooling stays out of production bundles.

## Implementation Philosophy
- **One Layer at a Time**: Never build multiple interdependent systems simultaneously
- **Stub and Ship**: `return true; // TODO: make smarter` is valid first implementation  
- **48-Hour Rule**: Any feature should show visible progress within 2 days
- **One Decision**: Each iteration adds exactly ONE decision point for players
- **Annotate Everything**: Mark all hardcoded values, stubs, and missing features with clear TODO/STUB/HARDCODED comments for easy identification later
- Commit incomplete working code > complete non-working code

# AI Dev Tasks
Use these files when I request structured feature development using PRDs:
/docs/ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md
/docs/ai-dev-tasks/generate-tasks.md
/docs/ai-dev-tasks/process-task-list.md

**Annotation Standards:**
```javascript
// STUB: Will be replaced with complex logic in Phase 2
return 50; 

// HARDCODED: Should read from balance.json eventually  
const approvalThreshold = 10000;

// TODO: Add artist personality factors to mood calculation
function calculateMood() { return Math.random() * 100; }

// MISSING: Reputation system integration needed
```

This ensures we can easily grep for `STUB:`, `HARDCODED:`, `TODO:`, and `MISSING:` to find what needs enhancement in future iterations.
