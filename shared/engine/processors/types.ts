/**
 * WeekContext — the shared dependency bundle passed to every engine processor.
 *
 * Phase 2 (engine seams) decomposes `GameEngine.advanceWeek` into a fixed-order
 * sequence of domain processors (AROfficeProcessor, ProgressionProcessor, ...).
 * Each processor receives a `WeekContext` instead of reaching into `GameEngine`
 * internals, so processors never construct their own dependencies and the call
 * sites in `advanceWeek` stay thin and uniform.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * RNG INVARIANT (see phase-2-engine-seams-plan §6 "RNG stream order = behavior"):
 *   `getRandom` MUST be the GameEngine's own bound seeded function
 *   (`this.getRandom.bind(this)` — or an arrow closing over `this`). The whole
 *   game shares a SINGLE seeded RNG stream, and outcomes for a given seed depend
 *   on the exact ORDER of draws from it. Processors must therefore draw only
 *   through this `getRandom`, and the engine must call processors in the exact
 *   pipeline order. Never hand a processor a fresh/unseeded RNG — that would fork
 *   the stream and change behavior (and break the golden master).
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `gameState` and `summary` are the engine's live objects — processors mutate
 * them in place (flags, arOffice columns, summary.changes, summary.arOffice),
 * exactly as the pre-extraction methods did.
