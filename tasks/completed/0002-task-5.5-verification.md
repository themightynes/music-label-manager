- [ ] Make a choice that affects artist mood
- [ ] Advance week
- [ ] Verify week summary shows mood change with:
  - Yellow circular icon (‚≠ê)
  - Text: "[Meeting Name] (Most Popular)"
  - Badge showing mood delta

#### 3. User-Selected Mood Effect (üë§)
- [ ] Navigate to executive meetings
- [ ] Select a meeting with `target_scope: "user_selected"` (e.g., ar_single_choice, cco_creative_clash)
- [ ] Select an artist from the artist selector UI
- [ ] Make a choice that affects artist mood
- [ ] Advance week
- [ ] Verify week summary shows mood change with:
  - Purple circular icon (üë§)
  - Text: "[Meeting Name] (Your Choice)"
  - Badge showing mood delta

#### 4. Dialogue Mood Effect (üí¨)
- [ ] Navigate to Artist Roster

- [ ] Complete artist dialogue conversation
- [ ] Make a choice that affects mood
- [ ] Advance week
- [ ] Verify week summary shows mood change with:
  - Green circular icon (üí¨)
  - Text: "[Artist Name] conversation" or similar
  - Badge showing mood delta

### Visual Verification Checklist

#### Mood Changes Card
- [ ] Card appears in Overview tab under "Mood Changes"
- [ ] Card title shows üí≠ icon and "Mood Changes" text
- [ ] All mood changes are grouped together

#### Individual Mood Change Display
For each mood change entry:
- [ ] Scope icon is in a circular badge (8x8) on the left
- [ ] Icon has correct color based on scope:
  - üåç Global: Blue background/border
  - ‚≠ê Predetermined: Yellow background/border
  - üë§ User-Selected: Purple background/border
  - üí¨ Dialogue: Green background/border
- [ ] Text description is clear and readable
- [ ] Mood delta badge is on the right
- [ ] Badge shows + for positive, no sign for negative
- [ ] Background color matches mood polarity:
  - Purple background for positive mood
  - Orange background for negative mood

#### DialogueInterface Effect Badges
When viewing meeting choices:
- [ ] Mood effect badges show scope context:
  - Global: "+X Mood (All Artists)"
  - Predetermined: "+X Mood (Most Popular)"
  - User-Selected: "+X Mood (ArtistName)" when artist selected
- [ ] Other effect badges display normally

## Expected Results

All four scope types should be visually distinct and easy to differentiate:
1. **Color coding** makes scope identification instant
2. **Icons** provide additional visual cues
3. **Text labels** clarify the scope for accessibility
4. **Layout** is consistent across all scope types

## Automated Test Results

- ‚úÖ All 362 tests passing
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ‚úÖ WeekSummary component renders without errors
- ‚úÖ DialogueInterface component renders without errors

## Notes

- This is primarily a visual/UX verification task
- Automated tests verify component logic works correctly
- Manual testing verifies visual styling and user experience
- All four scope types can theoretically occur in the same week if:
  1. CEO meeting with global scope is held
  2. Role meeting with predetermined scope is held
  3. Role meeting with user_selected scope is held
  4. Artist dialogue conversation occurs
