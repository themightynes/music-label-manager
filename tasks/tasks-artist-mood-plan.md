# Tasks: Artist Mood System - Phases 6-10 Implementation

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED** after Phase 5 (2025-10-12)
**Reason**: Core system is functional (Phases 1-5 complete). Enhancements (Phases 6-10) deferred pending player feedback on base mechanics.
**Source**: [`docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/[IN-PROGRESS] artist-mood-plan.md`](../docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/[IN-PROGRESS] artist-mood-plan.md)
**Implementation**: Incremental, following existing patterns

## üìä What's Complete (Phases 1-5)
‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Database constraints and validation
‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Visual mood indicators in UI
‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Mood calculation engine with multipliers
‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Mood impact on project quality
‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Monthly mood processing with workload/drift

## ‚è∏Ô∏è What's Paused (Phases 6-10)
‚è∏Ô∏è **Phase 6**: Dialogue integration (Task 2.0 - mostly complete, Task 2.4 was in progress)
‚è∏Ô∏è **Phase 7**: Mood-triggered events and warnings (Task 3.0)
‚è∏Ô∏è **Phase 8**: Enhanced UI feedback and recommendations (Task 4.0)
‚è∏Ô∏è **Phase 9**: Advanced mood factors - project performance, archetypes (Task 5.0)
‚è∏Ô∏è **Phase 10**: Mood analytics and predictions (Task 6.0)

## üîÑ Resume Criteria
Resume this work when:
1. Players have experienced base mood system (Phases 1-5) in production
2. Feedback indicates desire for more depth/complexity
3. Current priority features are complete
4. Team capacity available for enhancement work

## üéØ Current Status (Updated 2025-10-11)

**Recently Completed**:
- ‚úÖ **0002 Technical Debt** - Resolved all 4 items (commits f4e9bf1, 7742695, 829e151, e3cc72e)
  - Unified artist change format to per-artist objects
  - Added integration tests for database persistence
  - Refactored mood processing for clarity
  - Added type-safe helpers (`ArtistChangeHelpers`)
- ‚úÖ **0003 PRD** - Basic Artist Dialogue UI implemented

**Impact on This Plan**:
- **Task 2.3** is effectively complete - per-artist mood infrastructure is ready
- **Task 2.6** is complete - `ArtistStatChange` interface and helpers exist in `shared/types/gameTypes.ts`
- **Task 2.7** has a template - see `tests/engine/mood-persistence-integration.test.ts` for testing pattern

**Next Steps**: Resume with **Task 2.4** (mood event logging for dialogue choices). The infrastructure is ready:
- ‚úÖ Per-artist accumulation works via `ArtistChangeHelpers.addMood(summary.artistChanges, artistId, value)`
- ‚úÖ Type-safe with `ArtistStatChange` interface
- ‚úÖ Integration test pattern available
- ‚è≥ Just needs mood_events logging integration (follow pattern from `applyArtistChangesToDatabase()` line 2987-3008)

### ‚úÖ 2.0 Integrate mood changes with dialogue system (Phase 6 - Backend) - COMPLETE
**Goal**: Process artist_mood effects from dialogue choices and track mood history

**Status**: All subtasks complete (2.1-2.7) ‚úÖ | Committed: 628d610

- [x] 2.1 Review existing dialogue processing in GameEngine
  - ‚úÖ Read `shared/engine/game-engine.ts` - found `processArtistDialogue()` at line 3577
  - ‚úÖ Understand how `effects_immediate` and `effects_delayed` are currently processed - uses `applyEffects()` method
  - ‚úÖ Identified two patterns: global `summary.artistChanges.mood` (all artists) and per-artist `summary.artistChanges[artistId]` (specific artist)
  - ‚úÖ Current `processArtistDialogue` uses STUB random values instead of loading from dialogue.json
  - ‚úÖ `applyEffects()` already handles `artist_mood` effects (line 1045-1065)

- [x] 2.2 Load dialogue choice data from dialogue.json
  - ‚úÖ Created `getDialogueChoiceById(sceneId, choiceId)` method in `server/data/gameData.ts` (line 259)
  - ‚úÖ Updated `processArtistDialogue()` to load actual choice data instead of using random values (line 3577)
  - ‚úÖ Extract sceneId and choiceId from action.metadata (matching role_meeting pattern)
  - ‚úÖ Apply effects_immediate using existing `applyEffects()` method
  - ‚úÖ Queue effects_delayed for next week trigger
  - ‚úÖ Added fallback handling for missing dialogue choices
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Current implementation applies mood globally to all artists via `applyEffects()` - needs per-artist targeting

- [x] 2.3 Fix dialogue mood to apply per-artist (not global)
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: `applyEffects()` already uses per-artist pattern when artistId is provided
  - ‚úÖ Line 1164: `ArtistChangeHelpers.addMood(summary.artistChanges, artistId, value)`
  - ‚úÖ `processArtistDialogue()` correctly passes artistId to `applyEffects()` (lines 3932, 3953)
  - ‚úÖ Per-artist infrastructure from 0002 technical debt work is fully integrated

- [x] 2.4 Add mood event logging for dialogue choices
  - ‚úÖ Extended `ArtistStatChange` interface with `eventSource` metadata (gameTypes.ts:363-369)
  - ‚úÖ Updated `applyEffects()` to set eventSource when processing mood changes (game-engine.ts:1169-1188)
  - ‚úÖ Modified `applyArtistChangesToDatabase()` to use eventSource for mood_events logging (game-engine.ts:3008-3047)
  - ‚úÖ Dialogue choices now logged with eventType='dialogue_choice', sceneId, and choiceId in metadata
  - ‚úÖ Executive meetings continue to log with eventType='executive_meeting'

- [x] 2.5 Update dialogue.json with mood effects
  - ‚úÖ ALREADY COMPLETE: dialogue.json contains 9 dialogue scenes with artist_mood effects
  - ‚úÖ All 31 choices across all scenes have artist_mood values
  - ‚úÖ Values are balanced within -3 to +3 range (conservative, within -5 to +5 spec)
  - ‚úÖ Effects rationale documented in scene descriptions (emotional_state field)

- [x] 2.6 Update ChoiceEffect type if needed
  - ‚úÖ ALREADY COMPLETE: `artist_mood` field exists in ChoiceEffect interface (gameTypes.ts:26)
  - ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation verified (pre-existing codebase errors unrelated to this work)
  - ‚úÖ Interface properly typed: `artist_mood?: number;`

- [x] 2.7 Write tests for dialogue mood integration
  - ‚úÖ Created `tests/features/mood-dialogue-integration.test.ts` with 8 comprehensive tests
  - ‚úÖ Test: Positive mood effects (+5, +10) increase artist mood correctly
  - ‚úÖ Test: Negative mood effects (-5, -15) decrease artist mood correctly
  - ‚úÖ Test: Only targeted artist affected (per-artist targeting)
  - ‚úÖ Test: Mood events logged to mood_events table with eventType='dialogue_choice'
  - ‚úÖ Test: sceneId and choiceId stored in metadata
  - ‚úÖ Test: Multiple dialogue events for different artists
  - ‚úÖ Test: Mood respects 0-100 bounds (clamping works correctly)
  - ‚úÖ All 8 tests passing (1.56s)

**Implementation Notes**:
- artist_mood field already exists in ChoiceEffect interface
- Follow existing artist_energy pattern for implementation
- Use existing applyEffects() pattern if available
- Minimal changes - extend existing system only

  - Test: Artist mood >= 81 generates 'artist_mood_excellent' event
  - Test: Artist mood 50 (neutral) generates no event
  - Test: Events appear in WeekSummary.events array

**Implementation Notes**:
- Integrate with existing WeekSummary.events structure
- Use existing event patterns from GameEngine
- Keep threshold logic configurable via balance.json
