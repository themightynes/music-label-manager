## 🎮 PLAYABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Current State: Near-Playable** *(Major improvement!)*
- ✅ Can start game and see dashboard
- ✅ Can select actions and advance months
- ✅ Resources change and persist correctly
- ✅ **UI components exist** (DialogueModal, MonthSummary, SaveGameModal)
- 🚧 **Component integration incomplete** (not wired into game flow)
- 🚧 **Missing project creation flow**
- 🚧 **Missing artist expansion system**

**Critical Path to Full Playability (Revised):**
1. **Wire DialogueModal to MonthPlanner** → Enable role interactions
2. **Integrate MonthSummary with advancement results** → Show month feedback
3. **Add project creation flow** → Music creation system
4. **Connect SaveGameModal to UI** → Game persistence access

**Assessment:** The foundation is exceptionally strong AND most UI components already exist. The game is much closer to completion than initially assessed - main work needed is **integration and wiring**, not building components from scratch.
