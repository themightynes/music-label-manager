## ðŸŽ¯ **QUICK START FOR CLAUDE SESSIONS**

### **Project Identity**
- **Name**: Top Roles: Music Label Manager

3. **Ask before starting dev server**: "Should I start the dev server?"
4. **Always clean up** background processes at session end

## âœ… **RECENTLY COMPLETED** (Last 30 Days)

### **August 30, 2025 - Reputation System Analysis & Project System Documentation**
- âœ… **Comprehensive Reputation System Analysis** - Deep dive into reputation mechanics
  - âœ… Identified that Direct Projects (Single/EP) don't generate streams/revenue/reputation as intended
  - âœ… Found that project completion code (`processOngoingProjects`) is entirely commented out
  - âœ… Discovered planned releases only gain reputation from press coverage RNG, not base release bonuses
  - âœ… Documented missing features: hit single bonus (+5), chart #1 bonus (+10), flop penalty (-3)
  - âœ… Created detailed analysis document: `docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/reputation-research.md`
- âœ… **Project System Technical Documentation** - Analyzed recording vs release system architecture
  - âœ… Documented that Projects are recording-only (create songs) but contain significant dead code
  - âœ… Identified `calculateProjectOutcomes()` exists but is never called
  - âœ… Found songs incorrectly marked as "released" during recording instead of actual release
  - âœ… Created cleanup roadmap in `docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/project-system-analysis.md`
  - âœ… Clarified distinction between recording (Projects) and releasing (Planned Releases)
- âœ… **Access Tier Progression System Fixes** - Resolved all outstanding issues
  - âœ… Fixed tier name inconsistencies between database, GameEngine, and UI components
  - âœ… Standardized on lowercase tier names throughout backend with UI mapping layer
  - âœ… Implemented server-side tier upgrade notifications in MonthSummary
  - âœ… Fixed database default values and client-side game creation mismatches
  - âœ… Updated `docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/access-tier-progression-plan.md` with complete analysis
  - âœ… Result: Access tier progression now works correctly with proper visual feedback

### **August 29, 2025 - Focus Slots System & Content Data Architecture Refactoring**
- âœ… **Focus Slots System - Complete Implementation** - Connected action point system to gameplay
  - âœ… Fixed disconnected focus slots that weren't actually limiting action selection
  - âœ… Implemented live tracking - `usedFocusSlots` updates in real-time as actions are selected
  - âœ… Removed all hardcoded "3" references - UI now dynamically uses `gameState.focusSlots`
  - âœ… Added 4th slot unlock at 50+ reputation with automatic notification
  - âœ… Synchronized client/server state - proper reset to 0 on game load and month advancement
  - âœ… Updated all UI components (SelectionSummary, MonthPlanner, Dashboard) for dynamic limits
  - âœ… Result: Clear "2/3 Focus Slots, 1 available" live feedback throughout action selection
- âœ… **Focus Slots UI/UX Unification** - Enhanced terminology and visual consistency
  - âœ… Renamed "Available Actions" â†’ "Focus Actions Pool" for clear connection to Focus Slots
  - âœ… Updated action buttons to show "Use Focus Slot" with focus icon
  - âœ… Added visual slot indicators showing filled/empty states as progress bars
  - âœ… Implemented "Focus Cost: 1 Slot" display in action details
  - âœ… Changed messaging from "Select actions" to "Allocate focus slots"
  - âœ… Added tooltip explaining Focus Slots are monthly action points
  - âœ… Result: Users now clearly understand the resource-based action system

  - âœ… Enhanced `actions.json` with detailed action metadata (cost, duration, prerequisites, outcomes, benefits)
  - âœ… Added smart recommendation system with conditions and messages in action data
  - âœ… API enrichment layer automatically adds role meeting data to actions
  - âœ… Removed 100+ lines of hardcoded logic from MonthPlanner.tsx component
  - âœ… Single source of truth - all action data now lives in `/data/actions.json`
- âœ… **Category System Unification** - Consolidated category definitions
  - âœ… Moved category definitions from hardcoded UI component to `actions.json`
  - âœ… API now returns category data with icons, descriptions, and colors
  - âœ… ActionSelectionPool component uses data-driven categories from API
  - âœ… Updated Zod schemas for proper data validation
  - âœ… Full TypeScript type safety maintained throughout refactor
- âœ… **Benefits Achieved**
  - âœ… Eliminated all data duplication between frontend and data files
  - âœ… MonthPlanner component simplified to pure presentation layer
