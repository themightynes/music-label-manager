### **September 2025 - Song Quality System Enhancements**
- ✅ **Budget Impact Dampening System** - Reduced budget's dominance over quality calculations
  - ✅ Implemented configurable dampening factor (0.7) in quality.json
  - ✅ Reduces budget's impact on quality by 30% while maintaining strategic importance
  - ✅ Formula: `efficiencyRatio = 1 + 0.7 × (rawRatio - 1)` keeps ratio=1 neutral
  - ✅ Budget multiplier now ranges from 0.65x to ~1.35x (was 0.65x to 1.5x+)
  - ✅ Updated FinancialSystem.ts with dampening in both calculateBudgetQualityMultiplier and getBudgetEfficiencyRating
  - ✅ Synchronized ProjectCreationModal.tsx to apply same dampening in UI preview
  - ✅ Updated QualityTester.tsx testing interface with dampened calculations
- ✅ **Enhanced Variance System with Outliers** - More dramatic and exciting quality outcomes
  - ✅ Increased base variance ranges: Low skill ±35% (was ±20%), High skill ±10% (was ±5%)
  - ✅ Formula updated: `baseVarianceRange = 35 - (30 × combinedSkill/100)`
  - ✅ Added 10% chance for outlier events:
    - 5% Breakout Hit: 1.5x-2.0x multiplier (bigger boost for lower skill)
    - 5% Critical Failure: 0.5x-0.7x multiplier (high skill has protection)
  - ✅ 90% of songs use normal skill-based variance for consistency
  - ✅ Creates high-risk/high-reward dynamics for amateur artists
  - ✅ Elite skill combinations remain consistent but can still have surprises
- ✅ **UI Quality Preview Accuracy** - Complete frontend-backend synchronization
  - ✅ ProjectCreationModal now shows variance range (e.g., "Variance: ±17%")

### **September 5, 2025 - Budget Quality Calculation System Overhaul**
- ✅ **Fixed Piecewise Function Calculation Errors** - Corrected budget factor multiplier calculations
  - ✅ Fixed incorrect segment calculations that were causing cumulative errors (was 1.34, now correctly 1.14)
  - ✅ Replaced additive slope calculations with explicit start/end multiplier values for each segment
  - ✅ All 6 segments now properly interpolate: penalty (0.65), below standard (0.65-0.85), efficient (0.85-1.05), premium (1.05-1.20), luxury (1.20-1.35), diminishing (1.35+)
- ✅ **Removed Double-Counting of Producer/Time Multipliers** - Fixed economic calibration issue
  - ✅ Producer and time multipliers now only apply to project cost (what player pays)
  - ✅ Removed these multipliers from minimum viable cost calculation (quality baseline)
  - ✅ Added 1.5x baseline quality multiplier for recording sessions to properly calibrate system
  - ✅ Result: Minimum budget with cheapest options now gives appropriate -17% quality penalty instead of +14% bonus
- ✅ **Frontend-Backend Synchronization** - Complete consistency across the stack
  - ✅ Updated `ProjectCreationModal.tsx` to match backend's corrected piecewise function
  - ✅ Frontend `calculateDynamicMinimumViableCost()` now identical to backend implementation
  - ✅ Both use same formula: Base × Economies × 1.5 (no producer/time multipliers)
  - ✅ Verified with comprehensive test suite showing identical calculations
- ✅ **Skill-Based Quality Variance System** - More realistic randomization
  - ✅ Implemented dynamic variance based on combined artist talent and producer skill
  - ✅ Low skill (35 avg): ±13.7% variance - high risk/reward, potential breakout hits or failures
  - ✅ Mid skill (58 avg): ±9.7% variance - moderately consistent quality
  - ✅ High skill (78 avg): ±6% variance - very reliable professional output
  - ✅ Elite skill (95 avg): ±2.9% variance - extremely consistent, "they don't miss"
  - ✅ Formula: Variance = 20% - (18% × CombinedSkill/100), applied per song individually
- ✅ **Economic Balance Improvements**
  - ✅ Minimum selectable budget now appropriately penalizes quality (as intended)
  - ✅ Higher budgets provide meaningful quality bonuses without being excessive
  - ✅ Strategic trade-offs between budget, producer quality, and time investment
  - ✅ No more gaming the system with minimum budget for quality bonuses
- ✅ **Technical Implementation Details**
  - ✅ Maintained separation of concerns: project costs include multipliers, quality baseline doesn't
  - ✅ Each song in multi-song projects gets individual random variance (realistic album variation)
  - ✅ All changes backward compatible with existing save games
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with multiple scenario validations
