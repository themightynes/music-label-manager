## ðŸŽ¯ **QUICK START FOR CLAUDE SESSIONS**

### **Project Identity**
- **Name**: Top Roles: Music Label Manager
- **Type**: Browser-based turn-based music industry simulation  
- **Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + PostgreSQL (Neon) + Drizzle ORM
- **Status**: Post-MVP Feature Development - Sprint 3 (Week 5 of 12)

### **Critical Session Rules**
1. **Never start background processes** without explicit user permission
2. **Use static analysis tools** (Read, Glob, Grep) for code reviews
3. **Ask before starting dev server**: "Should I start the dev server?"
4. **Always clean up** background processes at session end

## âœ… **RECENTLY COMPLETED** (Last 30 Days)

### **August 29, 2025 - Data-Driven Action System & UI Unification**
- âœ… **Unified Action System Architecture** - Complete data-driven approach for game actions
  - âœ… Enhanced `actions.json` with detailed action metadata (cost, duration, prerequisites, outcomes, benefits)
  - âœ… Added smart recommendation system with conditions and messages in action data
  - âœ… API enrichment layer automatically adds role meeting data to actions
  - âœ… Removed 100+ lines of hardcoded logic from MonthPlanner.tsx component
  - âœ… Single source of truth - all action data now lives in `/data/actions.json`
- âœ… **Category System Unification** - Consolidated category definitions
  - âœ… Moved category definitions from hardcoded UI component to `actions.json`
  - âœ… API now returns category data with icons, descriptions, and colors
  - âœ… ActionSelectionPool component uses data-driven categories from API
  - âœ… Updated Zod schemas for proper data validation
  - âœ… Full TypeScript type safety maintained throughout refactor
- âœ… **Benefits Achieved**
  - âœ… Eliminated all data duplication between frontend and data files
  - âœ… MonthPlanner component simplified to pure presentation layer
  - âœ… Easy to add/modify/remove actions without touching code
  - âœ… Follows established architectural patterns from game engine
  - âœ… No breaking changes - fully backward compatible

### **August 26, 2025 - Financial System Architecture Refactoring**
- âœ… **FinancialSystem.ts Module Extraction** - Clean separation of concerns from GameEngine
  - âœ… Extracted all financial calculation methods from game-engine.ts into dedicated FinancialSystem.ts module
  - âœ… Converted all financial calculations to pure functions (no side effects)
  - âœ… GameEngine.ts now properly delegates all financial operations to FinancialSystem
  - âœ… Maintained full backward compatibility and existing functionality
- âœ… **Critical Bug Fixes & Code Quality Improvements** - Five targeted PRs completed
  - âœ… **PR 1: Division by Zero Fix** - Added parameter validation in calculateBudgetQualityBonus() with safety checks
  - âœ… **PR 2: Duplicate Code Elimination** - Created shared calculateDecayRevenue() method, eliminated ~120 lines of duplicate logic
  - âœ… **PR 3: Storage Dependency Fix** - Modified calculateMonthlyBurnWithBreakdown() to accept artist data directly
  - âœ… **PR 4: Constants Extraction** - Added CONSTANTS object with 15+ extracted magic numbers for easier balance tweaking
  - âœ… **PR 5: Debug Cleanup** - Commented out 32 console.log statements while preserving debug capability

### **August 23, 2025 - Plan Release System Bug Fix**
- âœ… **Single Release Conflict Resolution Fix** - Corrected song double-booking issue
  - âœ… Fixed ready songs API endpoint to properly filter out songs already assigned to planned releases

  - âœ… Synchronized GameContext and gameStore state management
  - âœ… Reliable game initialization and loading on app startup
- âœ… **Save Game Delete Functionality** - Complete save management system
  - âœ… DELETE /api/saves/:saveId endpoint with user ownership validation
  - âœ… Delete buttons in SaveGameModal with confirmation dialogs
