## 📅 Session Log — July 12, 2026 (Executive Delegation & Trust arc: Tiers 1+2 EXECUTED on `feat/exec-delegation-trust`, Tracks A–E, verifier findings fixed pre-merge — suite 1,868 → 1,933)

**Arc shape:** the formal reversal of the original exec-team design principle ("executives are tools to optimize, not people to manage") — plan doc `[READY] executive-delegation-and-trust-plan.md`, all 6 open forks (a–f) decided by Nes same day (fork f overridden: `ceo_crisis` keeps predetermined targeting rather than going global). Build authorized as Tiers 1+2 in ONE PR-train, factory pattern (one fresh subagent per track, orchestrator diff-review + adversarial verifier before merge, single mutating agent in the tree at a time). Tracks A–E: (A) config extraction of every hardcoded exec constant (loyalty gain/decay, mood drift, band thresholds) into `data/balance/progression.json` `reputation_system.executive_delegation`, pinned by a parity tripwire; (B) autonomous resolution — every un-acted exec-lane meeting never lapses, resolving via engine re-derivation of the offered meeting (fork e → option A: the same seeded selection pipeline the `/api/roles` route uses, re-run inside the transaction) and a loyalty-band + mood-risk-appetite choice policy (`shared/engine/executiveAutonomy.ts`); (C) CEO track structural changes — `ceo_crisis` migrated out of the CEO pool into the side-events pipeline as `crisis_fired_dancers` (predetermined-artist targeting preserved via a new optional per-event `target: "predetermined"` resolver mode), `ceo_chart_debut_strategy`'s dead inaction penalty removed; (D) escalation (Tier 2) — an urgent meeting self-resolved by a below-loyalty-ceiling exec can inject a mandatory crisis the following week via the existing #162 pipeline, with 4 escalation-only stub events (one per core-four archetype) excluded from the weekly weighted roll; (E) WeekSummary "While you were out" digest grouping autonomous resolutions separately from player decisions.

**Verifier findings, all fixed pre-merge:** a flaky mandatory-side-events crisis-money characterization test (unpinned `gameId`, FIX 1); a delayed-effect key collision where a neglected exec autonomously resolving the same choice in consecutive weeks would overwrite an unconsumed prior-week bank (targetId rescoped to include meeting id + offered week, FIX 2); a predetermined-event gating regression around the `crisis_fired_dancers` migration (FIX 3a/3b — crisis fiction + escalation rebalance); a self-serving-hint schema gap (FIX 6a) and predetermined-event gating fix (FIX 6b). Suite climbed **1,868 → 1,933** across the arc's commits (config extraction, autonomous resolution + golden-master coverage, CEO structural changes, escalation, and the fix commits).

**Tiers 3 (Level/XP) and 4 (Portfolios) are DESIGNED, NOT BUILT** — the plan doc specs both in full (§6/§7) but the build arc shipped only Tiers 1+2. Do not describe leveling or portfolio coupling as live anywhere.

**Content session dependency (unblocked, not yet scheduled):** three things the build arc deliberately left as structural-only, reserved for a live content session with Nes — (1) the CEO pool's "rarer and heavier" authoring pass (fewer trivial weeks, mostly `requires`-gated); (2) the actual prose for the 4 escalation-only stub events (`escalation_ar_botched_signing`, `escalation_cmo_narrative_lost`, `escalation_cco_artist_walkout`, `escalation_dist_deal_collapsed`) — currently placeholder/stub content sufficient for tests only; (3) a `self_serving_hint` authoring pass — only 2 choices are tagged today (`cmo_scandal.spin_collaboration`, `ar_genre_shift.chase_trends`); several meetings (`ar_discovery`, `cco_creative_clash`, the timestamp-id CCO meeting) produce weak-archetype self-serving picks under the numeric-proxy-only heuristic (logged as C91).

**This session's doc-sync pass (Track E, documentation & playtest instrumentation):** `[REFERENCE] executive-meetings-system-complete-reference.md` updated (§4 loyalty's first mechanical read + config extraction; §8 loyalty struck from deferred, Level/XP + Portfolios added as still-deferred, a new "AUTO-endorse vs. neglect server-indistinguishable" known limitation logged; new §10 autonomous resolution + §11 escalation, including the three-lane rule and the `ceo_crisis` migration note); `/admin/systems-map` gained 4 new live edges (loyalty→autonomous direction, mood→autonomous risk appetite, neglect→autonomous spend, low-loyalty urgent-neglect→escalation) plus updated `executive_loyalty`/`executive_mood`/`side_events` node descriptions; `docs/03-workflows/game-system-workflows.md` gained the autonomous-resolution step (4a, after player meetings) and the escalation-emission step (8a, before the weekly roll); the Label Head's Guide gained a 14th topic ("Delegation & Trust," qualitative-only, slotted right after "Your Executive Team"); a new playtest form **round 3** (`playtest-feedback-2026-07-12-delegation`, responses file `playtest-feedback-2026-07-12-r3.responses.json` — deliberately non-colliding with round 2's filename despite sharing a calendar date) covers the plan's §9 probes (autonomous-spend feel, AUTO-vs-neglect legibility, per-exec in-character reads, digest readability, escalation legibility, three-lane clarity, post-never-lapse economy, freeform) and carries forward round 2's still-open buzz-hidden-at-zero item; the stale Admin-index "Playtest Feedback (2026-07-11)" label (flagged in round 2's own pre-seeded findings) is fixed to point at the active round; three new backlog entries logged (C89 AUTO-endorse-vs-neglect dead knob, C90 side events lack a general requires/precondition mechanism — now load-bearing for `crisis_fired_dancers`, C91 the self-serving heuristic's weak-archetype meetings).

**▲ Round-3 live-playtest addendum (2026-07-12, `feat/exec-delegation-trust`, PR #167 — 5 live findings, all resolved this session; suite 1,933 → updated):** Nes played the arc live (notes at `docs/01-planning/playtest-live-notes-2026-07-12-delegation.md`, Entries 1–5) and surfaced one core mechanics bug plus digest-copy confusion:
- **Neglect economics (the core fix, Entries 3–5).** Live play showed neglected execs *gaining* mood/loyalty and parking at mood 100 — because the original build granted the autonomous resolution `mood_default_delta` (or authored `executive_mood`) AND marked the exec "used" (set `lastActionWeek` + added to `summary.usedExecutives`), which suppressed BOTH idle loyalty-decay AND mood-drift. Neglect was therefore a *reward*, and the `<40` escalation ceiling / `<30` self-serving band were unreachable. **Fix (neglect path only):** a new config knob `neglect_mood_gain` (default **0**) is the exec's mood self-effect on autonomous resolution (the authored `executive_mood`/`mood_default_delta` no longer apply); the exec is NO LONGER marked "used" and `lastActionWeek` is NOT set, so idle decay and mood-drift toward 50 resume. `neglect_loyalty_gain` stays 0. The choice's other effects (money/reputation/artist-mood/delayed banks) are unchanged. Player-attended and AUTO-endorsed paths untouched. Golden-master re-blessed (audited field-by-field, double-run clean) — only exec-row fixtures changed (`actions-week` + the autonomous/escalation fixtures gained decay entries and lost the phantom mood gain); the auto-vs-neglect divergence test now pins the starker 3-axis divergence (loyalty 70 vs 80, mood 50 vs 55, `lastActionWeek` unset vs set), and the delayed-key-collision test seed was raised (75→85 loyalty) so the exec stays loyal across two now-decaying neglect weeks.
- **Digest reframe (Entries 1 + 4).** The "While You Were Out / your team made N calls without you" framing was reworked to "Made Without You / your team made N decision(s) on their own" (the player objected to the "you were out" fiction); the exec's choice label is now rendered as their past call (`Their call: "…"`) so it no longer reads as advice to the player; and the "Mood" vs "Exec Mood" delta ambiguity was disambiguated (`artist_mood` → "Artist Mood", the exec-mood delta badge → "Exec Mood"), with the redundant/phantom authored `executive_mood` stripped from meeting entries' `appliedEffects` (post-neglect-fix it no longer lands on the exec, so it must not show a delta). The engine's autonomous change description likewise dropped "while you were out" → "handled this on their own." The Label Head's Guide "Delegation & Trust" topic now states (qualitatively) that sustained neglect quietly erodes the relationship over time.
- **C92 logged** (authored past-tense "outcome summary" field per choice for digest/results surfaces — the deeper fix behind Entry 1's render-site reframe; content session + additive schema).
- **Entry 2 (DECIDED status-quo, no change):** an exec on a non-meeting weekly assignment (e.g. A&R scouting) STILL auto-resolves their weekly meeting — delegated operations never lapse; recorded in the `[REFERENCE]` doc §10 as intended ("takes the call from the road").

**Open threads / next steps:**
- Nes: playtest round 3 on `feat/exec-delegation-trust` (dev server restart required — server-side engine code, no watch). Key watch-fors per the form: does autonomous spend read as "your team" or "losing money to bugs"; is the AUTO-vs-neglect trade legible; do disloyal picks read in-character per exec; does the "While you were out" digest survive a busy week; does escalation's loyalty connection read; does the three-lane distinction (exec/CEO/crisis) actually land; does the never-lapse economy quietly undo round 2's reputation-pacing work.
- Content session (CEO pool authoring pass + escalation event prose + `self_serving_hint` sweep) — the one round-3-adjacent ask not implementable by agents alone.
- Round-2's carried-forward buzz-hidden-at-zero item (a release with no banked hype shows no Buzz section at all in its first post-release week) remains open — still unresolved, now tracked in round 3's form too.
- Tiers 3+4 (Level/XP, Portfolios) are the natural next arcs once round-3 feedback lands — both fully specced in the plan doc, neither started.

## 📅 Session Log — July 11, 2026, evening (PLAYTEST-FEEDBACK IMPLEMENTATION ARC: #158–#163 all merged — six PRs in one orchestrated session)

**Arc shape:** merged the held Exec Console reskin (**#158**), then Nes's first STRUCTURED playtest feedback (captured via a new admin recording page) drove a four-track orchestrated implementation — design-architect brief → parallel worktree-isolated build agents → fresh-context adversarial verifier per track → merge on green. Merged `main` finished at **1,868 passed + 1 conditional skip** (from 1,712 at session start; +157 tests).

**Merged PRs:**
- **#158** Exec Console "The Board" reskin (held from 07-11 morning; presentation-only).
- **#159 small-ready-slices**: C87 tour energy drain (−6/city, `energy_cost` knob, GM revenue byte-identical), C86 four additive GM range fixtures, C76 audit/negotiate retune (pair non-dominant; `ignore` dominated by design), C85 guide 9→13 topics, PLUS the playtest capture system: retrospective markdown form + `/admin/playtest-feedback` page (GET/POST admin pair, validate→backup→write to a responses JSON). Ledger: C76/C85/C86/C87 struck.
- **#160 hype-board-ux** (client-only): banked-hype attach preview on PlanReleasePage (display mirror of the server fork-B rule, verifier-proven equivalent), weekly anticipation line (qualitative, leak-guarded), dashboard hype de-genericized (named pools + expiry hints), The Board previews the waiting brief (name + snippet, zero new requests; revises the Tier 2 no-name-on-card stance — why-now still reveals only on open).
- **#161 volatility-economy** (the engine core of the feedback): energy lifecycle (recording −4/wk, idle +3/wk recovery — `market_formulas.energy_lifecycle`), mood↔outcomes (flop −8 artist mood, breakthrough +5, drift liberated + amplified 3→5), flop penalty 3→5, **`reputation_gain_scaling` 0.7 on positive gains only** (fixes rep-100-at-week-21; losses unscaled), **C65 resolved** (press-coverage rep path capped), CC grants 3→5/6→9, relevance weight 2.0→3.0. **Load-bearing find: the GM fixture assembler had omitted `artist_stats` + `reputation_system` blocks entirely** — config there silently used code fallbacks in the golden master; now mirrored from `getBalanceConfigSync`.
- **#162 mandatory-side-events** ("Crisis on the Desk", Nes's product call): the seeded in-stream roll is untouched (byte-position-identical, verifier-confirmed); the rolled event defers to `flags.pending_side_event` and lands the NEXT week as a mandatory crisis card consuming one focus slot (SYNC_SLOTS threading incl. AUTO + server meeting-selection gate; A&R-busy + crisis stacks to −2); advance gated client+server (400 inside the FOR UPDATE transaction) until resolved; effects apply during that advance; kill-switch `mandatory_side_events.enabled`. **Verifier caught two real issues pre-merge**: a ~20–25% flaky characterization test (unpinned seed could roll a NEW crisis during the resolve-advance — deterministic stub + 10/10 flake-check) and an **orphaned-event advance deadlock** (event id deleted via Content Editor between defer and resolve → permanent 400; gate now steps aside so the engine self-heal clears the flag, regression-tested). SNAPSHOT_VERSION stays 2 (passthrough-verified round-trip).
- **#163 playtest-form-v2**: Round-2 feedback form (10 sections grounded in what shipped + Nes's round-1 answers: crisis drama/slot-cost/pacing, explicit re-tests of round 1's three "never saw it" mechanics, full-campaign rep-arc question) served by the same endpoint pair via a **formId allowlist** (no new routes; v1 responses file structurally unreachable from v2 saves, byte-for-byte tested + MD5-verified across two full local suite runs).

**Round-1 playtest findings (recorded in `docs/01-planning/playtest-feedback-2026-07-11.responses.json`)**: flop/mood-variance/energy all "never encountered" in ~20 weeks (root cause: mood+energy too stable) and rated too weak; rep gain "aggressive and quick" (rep 100 @ wk 21); CC too scarce; relevance too subtle; hype/awareness/reactive-meetings/tour-T1/Board all "sings" with surgical asks — every item above traces to one of these.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Nes: playtest round 2** on merged main (dev server restarted post-merge) and fill `/admin/playtest-feedback` (now Round 2). Key watch-fors: crisis drama + slot cost, energy rotation pressure, mood movement, a real rep arc, the re-tested flop beat.
- Feel knobs from this arc are all config (`energy_lifecycle`, `mood_drift`, `flop_artist_mood_penalty`, `reputation_gain_scaling`, `mandatory_side_events`) — round-2 feedback tunes values, not code.
- **Meeting-scenario content working session** (Nes live + Content Editor) — the one round-1 ask not implementable by agents.
- Deferred/known: latent `reputationScaling` rounding note (only if the knob ever drops below 0.5 a +1 gain rounds to 0); LOW cosmetics from verifiers (emoji truncation in Board snippet, missing useMemo in dashboard pools; exec-meetings [REFERENCE] doc may quote stale CC values 3/6→5/9).
- Carry-overs: C88 + remaining pending ledger (20 items), first copywriter changelog→doc-pass loop, Phase 4 audio audition.

## 📅 Session Log — July 9–11, 2026 (About/Help + Systems Map + Balance-Integrity arcs — MERGE DAY: #152/#154/#155/#156 all landed on main)

**One extended session, three stacked arcs, closed by a four-PR merge train** (Nes granted the merge via `/session-end and merge all branches into main`): **#152** (buzz-v2 hype & pre-marketing, built overnight 07-06/07, held for playtest — its arc details live in the PR description and the buzz-v2 spec) → **#154** (About page + Label Head's Guide) → **#155** (Systems Map admin tool) → **#156** (systems balance & integrity). Each retargeted to main and merged in order; merged main independently verified **tsc clean + 1,712/1,712 tests green**.

**Arc 1 — About page + The Label Head's Guide (#154).** Replaced the main-menu "Coming soon" About stub with `/about`: an in-fiction help section (research-driven design: CK3 game-concepts, NN/g progressive disclosure, journey ordering) — exec-voice preamble + **9 topics** (weekly loop, three currencies, access tiers, exec team, buzz/hype/awareness, releases, streaming economics, tours, charts). Content is data-only (`client/src/lib/helpTopics.ts`) with fork-E-style no-engine-numbers regex guards; scanning cues via a `HELP_TERMS` registry mirroring real UI colors ([[term]] markup + header chips ONLY on the topics that introduce their terms — Nes rule, test-pinned). Also: CommandDock ⋯ menu About link + came-from-aware back button. **C85** logged (topic expansion: A&R, mood, side events, saves).

**Arc 2 — Systems Map admin tool (#155).** `/admin/systems-map`: interactive SVG diagram of the whole engine — 23 nodes / 41 verified edges (each with formula + live balance values via static JSON imports + file:line ref), HARDCODED badges on code-literal knobs, and a **non-edges panel** (assumed-but-missing connections, verified: energy display-only, dead flop/decay config, C79-class shadowed configs, CC in no formula). Built from a fresh Opus engine recon, not docs. Detail panel + non-edges sit side-by-side under a full-width diagram (Nes layout feedback, 2 iterations).

**Arc 3 — Systems balance & integrity (#156).** Design review (`docs/98-research/SYSTEMS_BALANCE_REVIEW_2026-07-10.md`) → Nes approved all six recommendations ("spec all, fix everything; #3 as loss-leader view") → specced + EXECUTED same day, 6 sequential factory slices: (1) **knob liberation** — every flagged hardcoded constant → `data/balance/` config, byte-identical GM double-run, **C79 RESOLVED**; (2) **flop penalty** — reputation finally two-way (release-week revenue < 10% of ≥$10k investment → −3 rep once, renders in Achievements card); (3) **loss-leader view** — marketing economics surfaced on PlanReleasePage + help guide + ROI tooltip (economics untouched, Nes fork); (4) **low mood widens recording variance** (up to ×1.4 at mood 0, never narrows above baseline); (5) **artist energy drives tour sell-through** (×0.90–1.05 — energy's first engine consumer ever); (6) **tour popularity gains respect the saturation curve** via `min(1, satMult)` (orchestrator catch: naive curve reuse would have super-charged unknowns 1.5×). Per-slice GM policy held: byte-identical where required, audited explainable re-blesses (tour-estimate ×0.975 uniform; slice-6 popularity-only) elsewhere; zero RNG-stream changes. 28 new engine tests. Wrap: spec → `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] systems-balance-integrity-plan.md`, ledger **88 = 60 + 3 + 25** (C79 done; **C86** GM fixtures skirt the new ranges, **C87** touring doesn't drain energy, **C88** marketing attribution as structured data), plus a doc-sync sweep (`def02fd`) fixing 5 stale descriptive docs (headline: database-design.md's "energy does not alter economic calculations") with positive clean-attestation on the rest.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Playtest the merged mechanics** (⚠️ restart the dev server first — engine changes, no tsx watch): trigger a flop (≥$10k release returning <10%), feel low-mood volatility, tired-artist tours, saturated tour popularity; verify the PlanReleasePage loss-leader note + ROI tooltip live (never rendered in-session — the save had no signed artists).
- The Systems Map is now the living engine record + doc-sync target — re-verify edges when formulas change; tuning knobs are all liberated but **values deliberately untouched** this arc.
- C86 (GM fixture coverage for flop/low-mood/under-cap-tour ranges) is the natural next small slice; C87 (energy drain on tour) pairs with any tour feel work; C85 (help-topic expansion) whenever.
- Pre-existing `WeekTransition` setState-in-render warning (every GameLayout page) — a fix-task chip was spawned 07-10, still pending.
- Carry-overs: reactive meetings/side-events full-loop playtest, feel knobs untouched, C75/C76, Phase 4 audio audition, first copywriter changelog→doc-pass loop.

## 📅 Session Log — July 6, 2026, late evening addendum (Awareness Surfacing / C42 EXECUTED: breakthroughs visible, release Buzz, hottest track — verifier all-10-CONFIRMED; PR #151 stacked on #149, UNMERGED pending playtest)

**The C42 build ran the same evening** (Nes approved starting the design pass in parallel with the tour playtest window). Deep recon first, with the headline find: **the 🔥 BREAKTHROUGH moment was 100% invisible** — computed, pushed to `summary.changes`, even classified `'hero'` (Phase 4), but swallowed by WeekSummary's never-rendered `other` bucket along with all weekly `awareness_gain`/`awareness_decay` entries. Even PENDING-DECISIONS' "WeekSummary keeps celebrating a stat…" framing was stale — nothing celebrated. Other recon facts: the only engine read is the weeks-5+ streaming multiplier (cap 2.0×, `FinancialSystem.ts:1019-1049`); charts don't consume awareness; `breakthrough_thresholds` config is a dead block (hardcoded in ReleaseProcessor → C79); no release-level aggregation existed anywhere; two different mechanics both display as "Buzz" (song's live awareness vs the meetings channel banking a next-release seed).

**Design → checkpoint → all six forks decided by Nes** (`[READY] awareness-surfacing-plan.md`): **A** breakthrough = NOTABLE line, deliberately NOT a hero card (demotion from unrendered-hero); **B** one aggregated weekly buzz line, suppressed when total |Δ| < 3; **C** both keep the "Buzz" name with mutually cross-referencing tooltips; **D** hottest-song (max) aggregation; **E** **qualitative language only — no ×N multiplier numbers anywhere** (test-pinned with leakage regex guards); **F** dead config logged (C79), arc stays engine-free.

**Factory: 3 Sonnet slices on `feat/awareness-surfacing` (stacked on `feat/tour-experience-tier1` — both touch WeekSummary; retarget after #149 merges):**
- **Slice 1 (`b27c114`)** — `awareness`/`breakthroughs` buckets in `categorizeChanges.ts`; breakthrough NOTABLE lines + the aggregated `🎯 Buzz: 3 songs building (+12) · 2 fading` ROUTINE line; `breakthrough` reclassified `notable` in `changeImportance.ts`. Finding: awareness change entries are **description-only** (no songId/delta fields) → tolerant regex parsing, structured fields logged as **C80**. Suite 1,530 → 1,545.
- **Slice 2 (`8d44f08`)** — `ReleaseBuzzSection` on released cards via pure `summarizeReleaseBuzz` helper (`client/src/lib/releaseBuzz.ts`): hottest song + bar, 🔥 count, phase bands ("building — week N of 4" / ≥70 "sustaining strongly" / 30–69 "sustaining" / 1–29 "fading"); zero-awareness → no section. **Live-verified in a running week-52 game** (all 5 cards correct). Suite → 1,565.
- **Slice 3 (`c0028c0`)** — `HottestTrackStat` in all three MetricsDashboard layouts; SongCatalog Buzz chip finally gets a tooltip (new copy); `EFFECT_CHANNEL_DESCRIPTIONS.awareness_boost` gains a cross-reference clause (string literal only; [REFERENCE] doc verified to not quote the text — no sync needed). Suite → **1,578 green**.

**Fresh-context adversarial verifier (Opus): ALL 10 items CONFIRMED, no bugs** — engine containment exact (shared/ = importance classification + one display string), GM zero content deltas, fork-E no-numbers sweep clean, full gates reproduced (tsc clean, 1,578/1,578).

**Open threads:** Nes playtests #149 + #151 together (one dev-server checkout of `feat/awareness-surfacing` shows BOTH arcs); merge order #149 → retarget #151 → merge. Ledger: C79/C80 added (80 = 59 + 3 + 18 ✓). Unblocked once merged: Release-Experience Tier 2, the awareness design doc's surfacing chapter, effect-legibility Buzz channel (B1 direction).

## 📅 Session Log — July 6, 2026, evening (Tour Experience Tier 1: no phantom week, city cards, live status — verifier all-13-CONFIRMED; PR #149 UNMERGED pending Nes playtest)

**How the pick happened:** after the Content Editor arc merged (#146/#147; docs pass #148 still awaiting Nes's button), Nes asked for the next feature "but only after an Opus agent reviews other possibilities in the planning docs." The survey inventoried every candidate (planning specs, 08-future-features, pending debt, research case files) and found: **C42's framing was stale** (awareness engine already live at up to ~2× streaming; only the surfacing fork remained) and **Tour Tier 1 + Release Tier 1 outranked it on readiness × impact** (fully specced, decision-free). Two of the reviewer's claims didn't survive orchestrator verification: C40 (client-trusted refundAmount) and C41 (venueCapacity crash) were **already fixed pre-session** (PRs #66/#68 — the tour plan's bug list was stale; corrected this session). **Nes decided: build Tour Tier 1 now, and resolved C42 = wire awareness fully player-facing** (build queued as a next arc; PENDING-DECISIONS §2 removed, decision recorded in backlog C42).

**Factory: 3 slices + follow-up on `feat/tour-experience-tier1` (Opus for the engine slice, Sonnet for client; orchestrator diff-review before each dispatch):**
- **Slice 1 (`b01e812`, engine, Opus)** — **phantom third week removed**: tour completion check `>` → `>=`, the final city's revenue processes AND the tour completes in the SAME advance (completion totals from the tourStats RETURNED by `processUnifiedTourRevenue` — the loop-start row is stale; legacy in-flight saves keep the old fall-through). 1-city tour = 2 advances, 3-city = 4. Plus 10 structured city fields on the `tour_performance` change entry (description unchanged) and a **deterministic planning-week foreshadow** (`tour_planning` entry; `TourProcessor.estimatePlanningForeshadow` reuses the C41/C47/C48 param assembly with ZERO getRandom draws — the spec's "sell-through already known at planning" premise was wrong, pre-calc happens on the first production week). GM re-blessed additively (revenue amounts byte-identical), double-run zero updates. Suite 1,507 → 1,513.
- **Slice 1b (`93818d8`, orchestrator follow-up)** — artist reaction (`moodChange`/`popularityChange`) attached to the city entry itself so the client never re-matches separate entries or re-derives engine attendance thresholds. GM: exactly +2 fields, consistent with the pre-existing separate mood/popularity entries.
- **Slice 2 (`9d08d3c`, WeekSummary, Sonnet)** — categorization extracted to a pure module (`week-summary/categorizeChanges.ts`); `TourCityCard` in the NOTABLE reveal stage (attendance bar, gross/costs/net in money styling, reaction line, completion footer when the tour wraps that week); city entries de-duplicated out of the flat revenue list; `tour_planning` rendered in ROUTINE (was falling into the never-rendered `other` bucket). Financial figures verified decoupled (they read summary totals, not buckets). Suite → 1,522.
- **Slice 3 (`cf1937a`, dashboard, Sonnet)** — `TourStatusStrip` in the ActiveTours header: "🎤 Nova on tour — plays Theater Venues this week (city 2 of 4)" + last night's result; pure `deriveTourStatuses` helper; venue-name map deliberately duplicated locally (no engine-processor import into the client) → C78. Suite → **1,530 green**.
- **Sanctioned spec deviations:** no city-reveal toast (Phase 4 removed advance-time toasts as redundant with the modal — the card is the moment); foreshadow is a pre-variance estimate (see slice 1).

**Fresh-context adversarial verifier (Opus): ALL 13 items CONFIRMED, no bugs** — independent GM double-run (zero snapshot updates), RNG-stream audit (no added/removed/reordered draws in `git diff main...HEAD -- shared/`), scope containment exact (13 files), full gates reproduced (tsc clean, 1,530/1,530).

**Doc-sync (on the PR):** tour plan status header → Tier 1 EXECUTED with deviations; stale C40/C41 bug list corrected; sequencing struck through steps 1–3. Ledger: **C77** (tour-completion fixtures only exercise the legacy fall-through path) + **C78** (venue-name map duplicated engine/client) added; C42 decision annotated; a second header-drift fixed (the Pending line had said 13 without absorbing C76); arithmetic now **78 = 59 + 3 deferred + 16 pending ✓**.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Nes: playtest [PR #149](https://github.com/themightynes/music-label-manager/pull/149)** (book a 1-city tour → should be book → play → done in 2 advances, with the city card in WeekSummary, the foreshadow line on the planning advance, and the live strip in ActiveTours). ⚠️ Restart the dev server after checking out the branch — engine changes don't hot-reload. Then decide merge.
- **PR #148** (Content Editor post-merge docs pass) still open awaiting Nes.
- **Queued next arc: C42 awareness surfacing** (decided: wire fully — release page + dashboard readouts per `[FUTURE] awareness-system-design.md`; 1–2 UI slices, engine already live).
- Tour Tier 2 (roll each city on its own week, momentum, knobs → config) pairs with the game-feel track; Tier 3 (mid-tour decision) needs a PRD.
- Carry-overs: reactive meetings/side-events full-loop playtest, feel knobs untouched, C75/C76, first copywriter session exercising the changelog → doc-pass loop, Phase 4 audio audition.

## 📅 Session Log — July 6, 2026 (Content Editor: no-code side-events & meetings editing — designed, forked, built, verifier-CONFIRMED, playtested, MERGED as #146/#147)

**Goal (Nes):** upgrade the Actions JSON Viewer so a game designer/copywriter can edit side events AND meetings without code. **Merge authority: local-only this session — PR OK, NO merge until Nes finalizes + playtests.**

**Design pass first (hard checkpoint honored).** Recon established the as-is gaps with evidence: the viewer had no side-events support at all, couldn't see/edit `requires` or `reactive_trigger` (preserved-but-invisible), hardcoded a 6-key effect whitelist vs the canonical 13+1 (`LIVE_EFFECT_KEYS` ∪ `executive_mood` — seven live channels wrongly badged "not implemented"), offered a data-derived effect picker with a non-canonical `'new_effect'` fallback, read actions.json from the static bundle (prod-stale after save), and — the sharp one — **events.json edits would be invisible to a running server** because `dataLoader.loadAllData()` caches (same failure class as the July 5 stale-server mystery; actions.json dodges it via per-call re-read). Spec: `implementation-specs/COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] content-editor-side-events-and-meetings-plan.md`. **Nes decided all four forks same session: A3** (tool emits a machine-readable changelog — `data/content-changelog.json`, id-level `{added,modified,deleted}` per save, consumed by a later dev docs pass to satisfy the [REFERENCE]-doc pairing rule), **B1** (balance knobs read-only context strip), **C2** (dominance = HARD block at save, stricter than recommended), **D1** (full side-event add/delete).

**Factory: 3 slices on `feat/content-editor-side-events` (one fresh Sonnet subagent each, orchestrator diff-review before dispatching the next):**
- **Slice 1 (`5a3c4ef`, server/contracts)** — `GET/POST /api/admin/events-config` mirroring the actions pair (validate → backup → write); `EventsConfigSchema`/`SideEventContractSchema` in contracts deriving `category` from `SIDE_EVENT_CATEGORIES` (one-source pattern); **both content POSTs now `gameDataLoader.clearCache()`** (closes the events-cache staleness) and append the fork-A3 changelog (`server/utils/contentChangelog.ts`, pure diff + warn-only append). Route-manifest delta = exactly the two new routes. Suite 1,445 → 1,461.
- **Slice 2 (`c7dec05`, meetings tab)** — `client/src/admin/contentLint.ts` (pure lint mirror; `lintMeetings` hard-blocks non-canonical effect keys/tags/triggers, empty choices, dup ids, AND weakly-dominant choices — dominance model mirrored line-for-line from `meeting-dominance.test.ts`); ActionsViewer gains canonical effect picker with `EFFECT_CHANNEL_DESCRIPTIONS` blurbs, a `requires` checkbox editor (can never emit `[]` — omit-when-empty), a `reactive_trigger` selector with plain-language why-now copy, GET-endpoint data source (no static import; refetch-not-reload on save), and the lint gate before Zod before POST. Suite → 1,475.
- **Slice 3 (`2284fcd`, side events tab)** — page becomes the **Content Editor** (route unchanged `/admin/actions-viewer`; tabs: Meetings | Side Events; GameLayout wraps exactly once); `SideEventsEditor.tsx` with full event CRUD, category picker showing live weights, read-only knobs strip (weekly_chance 0.20 / cooldown 2 / weights, static import, display-only), "(no events yet)" note on zero-event categories (`artist_personal` today — fork E's authoring surface is now real); `lintSideEvents` (canonical keys/categories + category-must-have-weight, mirroring the data-lint hard assertion). Suite → **1,488 green**.
- **Deliberate design point:** `lintSideEvents` has **NO dominance check** — the meetings-only suite rule can't extend to events because the REAL `data/events.json` contains a weakly-dominant pair today (`royalty_discrepancy`: "negotiate" nets +2000 vs "audit" −500, all else equal → audit is never worth picking); a hard block would make the shipping file unsaveable. Logged as **C76** (🔵, content tuning = Nes's call); ledger now 76 = 59 + 3 + 14.

**Fresh-context adversarial verifier (Opus): ALL 13 items CONFIRMED, none refuted, no High/Medium findings** — gates independently reproduced (tsc clean; **1,488/1,488**; GM double-run green with zero snapshot rewrite), dominance mirror verified byte-identical, `requires: []` impossibility proven at the handler, real events.json confirmed to parse + lint clean through the new pipeline, engine-adjacent diff verified empty (`shared/engine/`/`server/` touched only by admin.ts + contentChangelog.ts).

**Doc-sync:** `data/CLAUDE.md` (in-slice) + `backend-architecture.md` admin-endpoint list (this pass; it had predated even the actions-config pair). Spec stays `[READY]` until the branch merges (then → `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE]`).

**First playtest feedback, fixed same day (slice 4, `8adf014`):** Nes: "a new action gets put at the very bottom — should be a pop-up." Both tabs' instant-append-a-blank-template creation replaced with a Dialog (shadcn primitive already in repo): identity fields up front (Meetings: name/description/role/category/scope/icon; Side Events: prompt/role_hint/category), ID auto-slugged from name/prompt but editable with inline uniqueness validation, and the created item now renders at the TOP of the list, auto-expanded — display-order only, save-output composition unchanged. New shared pure helpers `slugifyId`/`isIdAvailable`/`orderWithNewestFirst` (`client/src/admin/utils.ts`). Suite → **1,507 green** (+19); tsc clean; GM double-run zero-delta; pushed to PR #146.

**MERGED (same session):** Nes playtested live (one finding → slice 4, confirmed good) and granted the merge: **PR #146 (`9b025b0`) + docs PR #147 (`ea15cf2`)**; merged main independently verified tsc-clean + **1,507/1,507 green**; spec moved to `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE]` in the post-merge docs pass with execution deviations recorded in its header.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- Operational note for content editing: both tabs fetch live files and saves clear the server data cache — no restart needed for CONTENT edits (server-CODE changes still need restarts).
- C76 (royalty_discrepancy dominant choice) — trivial content tuning whenever Nes wants; until fixed, the events-lint dominance omission is load-bearing.
- First real copywriter session will exercise the changelog → doc-pass loop (fork A3) for the first time — watch that it actually gets consumed.
- Carry-overs: full-loop playtest of reactive meetings + side events, feel knobs untouched, C75, Phase 4 audio audition.

## 📅 Session Log — July 5, 2026 (MERGE DAY + meeting-relevance Tier 0+1 arc: #119/#120/#121 landed, then spec → 3 factory PRs #122–#124 same day, verifier-confirmed)

**Morning — the revival arc closed out.** Nes authorized the frozen-branch push: `feat/exec-meetings-revival` fast-forwarded `5fdea64` → `d562d0d` (subagent-executed, pure FF verified). Then per Nes: **PR #119 merged (`bbcacef`), #120 retargeted to main and merged (`e6b4723`)** — merged main verified 1,253 green + tsc clean — followed by the queued post-merge docs pass as **PR #121** (`d3ddc2f`): revival plan → `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE]`, C71 reference-doc sync (email + exec-meetings references), ledger recount (71 = 54+3+14), docs/CLAUDE.md exec-meetings signpost pruned. (A direct docs push to main was classifier-blocked → docs branch + PR, matching the house convention.)

**Afternoon — the Tier 0/1/2 fork decided and EXECUTED.** Nes chose **Tier 0+1 as one planned slice** (Tier 2 deferred, paired with side-events — PENDING-DECISIONS §1); planning pass produced `[READY] meeting-relevance-tier0-1-plan.md` with a load-bearing correction: **meeting selection lives in the roles route (`executives.ts`), NOT the advanceWeek engine path — expected golden-master delta ZERO** (the `[FUTURE]` doc's re-bless warning was conditional and didn't apply). Hard checkpoint passed (Nes approved incl. the **empty-pool sit-out rule**; AUTO = **Option A propose-then-confirm**). Factory then ran one fresh subagent per slice, orchestrator diff-review + full gates (tsc, full suite, golden-master double-run) before each self-merge (per-session grant):
- **PR-1 #122 (Tier 0, Sonnet)** — 6-tag `requires` vocabulary on all 20 meetings (close-read per spec §1; `ceo_priorities` rewritten state-agnostic), pure pipeline `shared/engine/meetingSelection.ts`, route filter, sit-out UI + AUTO skip, data-lint sibling suite, Zod ×2 from one canonical const. Suite 1,278 (+25). C72/C73 logged (content-honesty warts).
- **PR-2 #123 (Tier 1, Sonnet)** — `seededWeightedPick`, situation→category weighting, `weekly_meeting_selection` balance block (2.0/4w), recency signals from real columns (`signedWeek`/`releaseWeek`), + the deferred route characterization test. **Orchestrator review caught a real bug: the release-recency window was past-facing — a planned release's week is in the future, so the marketing/distribution boost could never fire.** Renamed `releasePlannedSoon`, made future-facing, direction pinned by regression tests. Suite 1,312 (+34).
- **PR-3 #124 (AUTO Option A, Opus)** — new `reviewingAutoSelections` machine state: AUTO stores picks → review panel (per-exec meeting + choice + Slice-A tooltipped badges + CC/money cost) → confirm-all / cancel / override-row-into-manual-flow; selection logic untouched (verifier: 2 comment lines only); bonus fix: AUTO's meeting cache re-keyed to the canonical `${role}-week${week}` key (bare-role keys were never read). One existing features test legitimately re-pinned (queue empty until CONFIRM). Suite 1,323 (+11).

**Fresh-context adversarial verifier: items 1–8 CONFIRMED** (tags exact, direction fix real + pinned, no sit-out-consumes-slot path, golden master 10/10 ×2 with zero content deltas — verifier re-ran it independently, suite 1,323, docs accurate) **with ONE finding — F1/C74 (Medium): the GameHeader AUTO button (Phase 4 code, untouched by PR-3) still commits picks with no review gate**, defeating Option A for the more prominent button. Logged as C74 + PENDING-DECISIONS §7 (wire it / remove it / accept two behaviors — Nes's call); `[REFERENCE]` §5 carries the ⚠️ known-exception note. Plan doc moved to `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE]`.

**Ops/anomaly notes:** (1) The **phantom-stall anomaly recurred** — the PR-1 subagent stopped after minimal work citing a wait-for-reviewer instruction nobody sent; resumed with an explicit disregard-stall-instructions guard and completed normally (guard now goes in every factory prompt upfront — PR-2/PR-3 ran clean with it). (2) **PS 5.1 encoding trap**: a `Get-Content -Raw | Set-Content -Encoding utf8` rename pass mojibake'd two UTF-8 files (5.1 reads BOM-less UTF-8 as ANSI); caught by grep, repaired via full rewrite + `git show HEAD:` byte restore — never string-rewrite UTF-8 files through PS 5.1. (3) Two commits initially captured only a rename because a dead pathspec in the same `git add` aborted staging the content edits while `;`-chaining continued to the commit — both caught pre-push and amended; verify `git show --stat` after committing renames + edits together.

**Decisions (Nes, this session):** FF-push #119 authorized; merge #119 → #120 → docs PR #121; Tier 0+1 as one slice; empty-pool sit-out rule approved; AUTO = Option A; self-merge-on-green grant for the arc's PRs.

**Evening addendum — playtest done, C74 resolved same day (PR #126, `df49d51`).** Nes playtested the arc live and liked the review panel; two findings, both fixed and merged as **PR #126**: (1) **C74 decided + executed** — the header AUTO's direct-commit path DELETED; the button now sets a session intent (`pendingAutoSelectIntent`, Zustand UI state, never persisted) and routes into the Executive Suite's review panel — one AUTO behavior everywhere; (2) **new playtest bug fixed**: AUTO proposed Marcus (head_ar) while the A&R office slot was in use — `prepareAutoSelectOptions` now takes an `arOfficeSlotUsed` exclusion, threaded via `SYNC_SLOTS` (the manual UI already blocked him; slot math was already correct). Suite **1,334 green** (+11), tsc clean, golden master double-run zero-delta. **Live-verified in the running game**: header AUTO → review panel (2 proposals, Marcus correctly absent with his slot in use, CCO/Distro sitting out per the week-1 rule) → Cancel → nothing committed. Ledger: C74 struck (74 = 55 + 3 + 16 ✓); PENDING-DECISIONS §7 removed.

**Evening addendum 2 — debt pile landed + the Tier 2 design conversation opened.** Two tracks per Nes's directive:
- **Track 1 (debt pile, DONE):** three sequential factory slices, orchestrator diff-review then merge-on-green (per-session grant re-confirmed): **C70 → PR #128** (campaign-end summary now interpolates `campaign_length_weeks` from balance config — can't rot again; regression pin in the advance-week characterization test), **C72 → PR #129** (`ar_genre_shift` copy made roster/genre-agnostic, `[REFERENCE]` quote synced), **C73 → PR #130** (`cco_creative_clash` copy-softened to a direction clash honest for idle artists; road not taken: picker restriction + tag tightening). Suite 1,334 green at every slice; ledger now 74 = 58 + 3 + 13. *Ops note:* the three agents were initially launched in parallel and collided on the shared working tree (concurrent checkouts) — caught immediately, work salvaged via patch, re-run strictly sequentially; parallel build agents need worktree isolation or serialization.
- **Weighting decision (Nes):** relevance weighting (2.0/4w) **explicitly left alone** — one playtest session isn't enough signal to tune a feel knob; revisit after more play.
- **Track 2 (Tier 2 + side-events + mood, AT CHECKPOINT):** design space researched and presented as six forks with recommendations — see PENDING-DECISIONS §1 for the full record ("WHERE IT STOPPED"). Headline research facts: side events are half-alive (a weekly 20% roll already burns an RNG draw INSIDE the golden-master stream at `game-engine.ts:967`, picks one of 13 fully-authored events, and the result is invisible — no UI reads `summary.events`; selection is unseeded `Math.random()`, C64); every canonical Tier 2 trigger (chart debut, release out, tour wrap, mood change, signing) is already persisted with a week number, so reactive meetings can stay route-side with zero golden-master impact, same as Tier 0+1. Nes folded **mood phases 6–10 (former §5) fully into this design call**. Awaiting Nes's fork decisions (A–F); no spec written yet by design (hard checkpoint).

**Evening addendum 3 — Tier 2 DECIDED → SPECCED → MVP-1 SHIPPED and playtest-verified, same evening.** Nes decided all six forks (A1/B1/C2/D1, E+F per recommendation) and approved the spec with three amendments (urgency indicator → PR-2; mood_crater completeness verification → PR-1; named playtest gate after PR-2); spec promoted to `[READY] tier2-reactive-meetings-and-side-events-plan.md` (#133). Factory then shipped MVP-1:
- **PR-1 #134 (dark launch)** — `shared/engine/weekHappenings.ts` (pure derivation), pre-draw injection in `meetingSelection.ts` (event-gated reactive meetings, isolated-seed tie-break), route threading with additive `reactiveContext`, Zod ×2, reactive data-lint. Both §9 verifications resolved with evidence: **tour_wrapped DROPPED** (no queryable completion week; CEO reassigned to chart_debut), **mood_crater honestly narrowed** to discrete-event craters (drift/stress don't log `mood_events` rows; threshold pinned 20). Suite 1,334 → 1,376.
- **PR-2 #135 (lights up)** — 5 authored reactive meetings (one per exec), why-now line (MeetingSelector + AUTO review rows, one shared formatter), urgency dot on exec cards off the existing sit-out prefetch (zero new requests). Orchestrator review caught a fresh C72-class honesty wart pre-merge ("charted for the first time" on an every-debut trigger — reworded). Suite → 1,398.
- **Playtest gate (Nes amendment 3) — played, two findings, fixed same session as #136**: (1) **engine-event week semantics** — release/chart/mood reactions landed a decision phase late; root cause: `currentWeek` increments at the TOP of advanceWeek, so engine events are stamped with the ARRIVAL week; `deriveWeekHappenings` now uses per-stamp-class windows (recent_signing keeps N−1; engine events use currentWeek), direction-pinned both ways; (2) **AUTO re-proposed an already-picked exec** — `usedExecutiveRoles` now threads through SYNC_SLOTS (the #126 `arOfficeSlotUsed` precedent) and `prepareAutoSelectOptions` excludes them. Suite → **1,403 green**; golden master double-run zero deltas at every slice (route-side by construction). **Nes verified both fixes live and answered the gate: CONTINUE to MVP-2** (side events — PR-3/PR-4).
- *Ops notes:* a fresh subagent variant-stalled by SUB-DELEGATING its build to a background child and stopping — corrective "do all work yourself, no sub-delegation" now joins the anti-stall guard in factory boilerplate; the resumed agent disclosed the phantom child had briefly run concurrently, so the orchestrator independently re-ran all gates before merging (clean).

**Evening addendum 4 — MVP-2 shipped: side events are ALIVE (the interactivity-gap's finding 1, dead for the game's whole life, now closes).**
- **PR-3 #138 (Opus, engine-adjacent)** — the weekly 20% roll stays byte-in-place in the RNG stream (fork D1, zero re-bless); on a hit, selection runs on an isolated seed (`sideEventSelection.ts`) honoring the authored-but-dead `event_weights` (a `category` field authored onto all **12** events — the research sweep's "13" was a miscount) and `event_cooldown` via flags; `pending_side_event` set; full payload pushed into `summary.events`; unresolved events LAPSE next advance with no effects; `POST /api/game/:gameId/side-event-choice` applies immediate effects at choice-time (dialogue precedent; artist-scoped keys apply roster-wide per the meeting `global` scope precedent, mood rows logged per artist) and banks delayed effects for the existing drain. **C64 closed.** Orchestrator review catch: the delayed-effect flag key used `Date.now()` — nondeterministic state in save snapshots — fixed to deterministic week-based keys, exact key pinned in the characterization test. Suite → 1,432.
- **PR-4 #139 (Sonnet, client)** — the WeekSummary staged reveal gains the side-event beat at STAGE_HERO ("and then THIS happened"): event card + 3 choices with `LIVE_EFFECT_KEYS`-whitelisted badges (ChoiceEffects/EffectBadgeTooltip reuse), resolution through a new sanctioned spine path (`resolveSideEvent` → `adoptServerSideEventResolution`, a SIBLING of adoptServerBalances via the commitGameState funnel — now the store's 13th spine writer, client/CLAUDE.md updated), artists query invalidated when artist-scoped effects apply, one-shot-per-week driven off `flags.pending_side_event`, 409 → quiet "the moment passed." Suite → **1,440 green**; golden master double-run zero deltas at every slice (orchestrator re-ran gates independently on both PRs).
- **Arc wrap:** spec → `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] tier2-reactive-meetings-and-side-events-plan.md` (execution deviations recorded in its header); PENDING-DECISIONS former §1 closed and removed; artist-mood-plan header carries the phases 6–10 disposition; ledger 74 = 59 + 3 + 12 (C64 ticked).
- **Fresh-context adversarial verifier: ALL TEN arc items CONFIRMED** with file:line evidence — incl. the weekly roll verified BYTE-IDENTICAL vs pre-arc main by direct `git show` comparison — and gates independently reproduced (1,440/1,440, golden master ×2, zero content deltas). **One substantive finding, F1 (Medium): concurrent double-apply on the side-event choice endpoint** (two tabs / a retry could both pass the pending check off the middleware's unlocked read → double money) — **fixed same session as PR #141** with the D6 discipline: validate-and-apply inside one `db.transaction` + `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` re-read (disk I/O outside the lock), loser 409s; a real two-concurrent-POSTs regression test pins exactly-once application. Suite → **1,441 green**. F2 (dead `artist_personal` weight — the reserved mood-content slot, accepted) and F3 (mood_crater's documented narrowing) on record, no action; the client/CLAUDE.md spine-writer count nit fixed in the same PR.

**Late-night addendum 5 — extended playtest: one mystery solved, one exploit closed.**
- **"17 weeks, zero side events" — NOT the RNG, NOT the pipeline: a STALE DEV SERVER.** `npm run dev` runs `tsx` WITHOUT watch — server/engine code loads once at boot and never hot-reloads (Vite HMR is client-only). The running process predated PR #138, so every advance rolled the OLD dead `checkForEvents` while the new client beat correctly ignored the payload-less legacy notifications. Settled by a no-mocks diagnostic driving the REAL loader + seed math (config 0.20 ✓, 12 events ✓, selection ✓, ~7 hits/30 synthetic weeks). Server restarted; ⚠️ caveat added to CLAUDE.md's dev-server line (**PR #143**): restart after ANY server-side merge before live verification.
- **CC free-lunch exploit (Nes playtest find, fixed as PR #144, playtest-CONFIRMED):** meeting choices with Creative Capital costs were selectable at 0 CC — no affordability gate existed anywhere in the manual flow, and `ActionProcessor`'s `Math.max(0, …)` clamp silently erased the unpayable cost (full payoff, nothing paid; AUTO was ironically stricter, budgeting CC since revival bug #11). `DialogueInterface` now takes an optional `availableCreativeCapital` and DISABLES unaffordable choices with a "Needs X — you have Y" note, reusing AUTO's `getChoiceCreativeCapitalCost` so both paths share one cost math; engine clamp kept as backstop (rejection = golden-master surface + worse UX). Residual logged as **C75** (🔵): the gate checks current CC, not net of already-queued choices this week (ledger 75 = 59 + 3 + 13). Suite → **1,445 green**.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Play the full loop**: reactive meetings + side events together — the side-event beat fires ~1 week in 5 (now actually reachable — see the stale-server note above); feel-tuning knobs on record: `weekly_chance` 0.20, `event_cooldown` 2, relevance 2.0/4w, mood-crater threshold 20 (all explicitly left alone pending play).
- `artist_personal` side-event category has 0 authored events — the reserved slot for mood-driven side-event content (fork E's future authoring surface).
- C75 (CC gate vs queued choices) is the newest small debt; fix shape recorded in the ledger.
- Nes still owes the Phase 4 in-game audio audition.
- Carry-overs: remaining ledger pendings (13, all 🔵 low except C62 🟢).

## 📅 Session Log — July 4, 2026, later session (PR #120 STACKED on #119: Group D debt fixes + legibility Slice A + Email Narrative Phase 1 — #119 stays frozen/UNMERGED)

**Orchestrated factory session (Fable + one fresh subagent per slice, orchestrator diff-review before every commit, fresh-context adversarial verifier after Group D and at wrap).** All work on **`feat/session-fixes-legibility-emails` = PR #120, base `feat/exec-meetings-revival` (NOT main)** — #119 is frozen per decision (no new commits/rebase/merge). Decision-free scope only; every gated item logged, not built. Suite **1,189 → 1,253 green** (+64), tsc clean at every commit.

**Group D debt fixes (regression tests on each; all four CONFIRMED by a fresh-context adversarial verifier that re-ran the suite independently):**
- **C60** (`7898de6`) — delayed `artist_energy`/`artist_popularity` effects now respect `artistId`, mirroring `artist_mood` (was: a one-on-one dialogue's delayed effect hit the whole roster). Global no-`artistId` branch pinned unchanged. +5 tests incl. end-to-end `processDelayedEffects` threading.
- **C58** (`3d8066a`) — optimistic stale-week guard: client always sends `expectedCurrentWeek` (optional in `AdvanceWeekRequest`, backward-compatible); server 409s (`ADVANCE_WEEK_CONFLICT`, new `AdvanceWeekConflictError`) inside the FOR UPDATE lock; calm client toast. Double-click can no longer advance two weeks. +5 tests.
- **C62 PARTIAL** (`f1b1315`) — Media Mogul now requires the true maxima (flagship/national; was unearnable `=== mid` tiers); 12-week → 52-week copy (HARDCODED: comments). **Zeroed `artistsSuccessful`/`projectsCompleted` deliberately NOT built** — undefined semantics + missing data plumbing = gated; logged in PENDING-DECISIONS.md. +6 tests.
- **C51** (`6e945e3`) — "On Tour" badge ends the week the last city plays: shared `getArtistStatus` in `tourHelpers.ts` reuses ActiveTours' city-count check; ArtistCard/ArtistRoster both consume it (client-only per decision). +10 tests.

**Features (mechanism + UI + tests per spec):**
- **Legibility Slice A** (`af99a29`) — `EFFECT_CHANNEL_DESCRIPTIONS` (14 entries, co-located with `LIVE_EFFECT_KEYS`, drift-guard test mirrors data-lint) + `EffectBadgeTooltip` on all four whitelisted badge renderers. Pure additive UI; directions B/C untouched (spec's open questions stand). +13 tests.
- **Email Narrative Phase 1** (`c86f707`) — exec-voiced mood-banded emails: `emailNarrative.ts` (5 mood bands, FNV-1a deterministic variant/quirk/timestamp selection — no Math.random, no seeded-stream consumption) + `emailTemplates.ts` (6 categories × 5 bands; Mac/Sam/Pat/Dante per guide); exec moods loaded read-only inside the D6 transaction, fail-soft to neutral; additive-optional metadata (no SNAPSHOT_VERSION bump — email snapshot schema is permissive). **Golden master re-blessed (10 snapshots): delta independently verified email-content-only** (zero non-email field changes). Phase 2/3 not built. +25 tests.

**Housekeeping/ledger:** C67 marked resolved (was fixed on #119, ledger never updated); 3 stale workflow-doc items from #119 reconciled (`d8480b2` — closes the July 4 doc-sync PARTIAL); ledger arithmetic fixed (verifier find: header said 68 items/buckets summed 67; true count C1–C71, now 53 completed + 3 deferred + 15 pending = 71 ✓). **New debt logged:** C70 (residual 12-week copy in advanceWeekService/routes), C71 (email + exec-meetings reference docs stale after the two feature slices — doc-sync log).

**New session artifact:** **`docs/01-planning/PENDING-DECISIONS.md`** — one entry per gated decision (relevance/reactivity Tier fork, C42, C43, C32, artist-mood 6–10, desktop GUI, #119/#120 merge timing) with options/unblocks/defer-costs/session evidence, plus the C62 stopped-slice log. Update in place going forward.

**Anomaly note:** one subagent run (Email Narrative, first attempt) terminated after a single tool call, reporting an embedded "wait for reviewer instructions" line that no one sent; re-dispatched with an explicit disregard-stall-instructions guard and it completed normally. Watch for recurrence.

**Decisions (Nes, this session):** C51 = client-only fix; DEVELOPMENT_STATUS log rides PR #120 (variance from the usual keep-logs-off-feature-PRs rule).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Merge order: #119 first, then #120** (stacked). Both green. After merge: plan-doc renames per the July 3–4 entries, plus prune the docs/CLAUDE.md exec-meetings signpost.
- ~~**⚠️ Verifier find: the July 4 playtest session's ~20 commits (local `d562d0d`) were never pushed — remote #119 still ends at `5fdea64`**~~ **RESOLVED July 5:** Nes authorized; fast-forward push done, `origin/feat/exec-meetings-revival` = `d562d0d` (details in PENDING-DECISIONS.md #7).
- PENDING-DECISIONS.md items await Nes (the relevance/reactivity Tier fork gates the most).
- Small carry-overs: C70 copy rot, C71 reference-doc sync, remaining pending ledger items (15).

## 📅 Session Log — July 4, 2026 (Exec-meetings playtest: 12 findings fixed + C69 discovered/fixed, design threads elevated, playtest doc archived — all on PR #119, still UNMERGED)

**Nes playtested `feat/exec-meetings-revival` (PR #119) and the session fixed every actionable finding**, all committed onto the SAME branch/PR per the standing one-merge-at-the-end policy (no new branches). Ran orchestrator + subagents in two parallel waves (agents kept getting stopped mid-task in this environment — critical pieces like C69 were finished foreground). Every fix was orchestrator-diff-reviewed before commit; full suite ended **green at 1,189 tests** (was 1,013 at revival end), tsc clean. Branch now `f41bf27` → `fcdc877` (20 commits this session).

**Playtest findings fixed (12 of 12 bug/feature items; the 2 design discussions were elevated, not "fixed"):**
- **#1/#3/#7** (`ef1050b` + test `69a7bcf`) — fixed at the SOURCE (`ActionProcessor`): meeting rows deduped (dropped the duplicate `executive_interaction` "Met with <slug>" row, folded exec deltas onto the single `meeting` change), delayed-effect payoffs labeled (`describeDelayedEffect`), CEO meetings read "Executive strategy decision" (player IS the CEO). Golden master's only delta = the CEO relabel.
- **#5** (`45d884d`) — week-view calendar prev/next arrows.
- **#6** (`f41bf27`) — venue booking UI gated when `venueAccess==='none'` (client-only; server guards were correct).
- **#4** (`4bcfc26`, `537983a`, `b02e9bf`, `3a74535`) — talent surfaced on 7 surfaces (roster cards, profile grid, dialogue, management, Live Performance + Recording Session dropdowns, Plan Release). Plan Release also needed a **server fix** (`3a74535`): the `ready-for-release` endpoint never SELECTed popularity/talent → they rendered 0 until fixed.
- **#9/C68** + **#12** (`5b44d9e`) — tour milestones read Planned/On Tour/Tour Completed (not "recorded stage"); tour-completion email shows NET profit (gross alongside). `GameChange` gained additive `totalCosts`/`netProfit`.
- **#11** (`b482c5e`) — AUTO-select is now Creative-Capital-budget-aware (can't overdraw). `creativeCapital` threaded into the XState machine context.
- **#2** (`52dd7be`) — Weekly Results popup auto-opens from ANY route (consumer moved from Dashboard-only to always-mounted `CommandDock`).
- **#8/C67** (`071c6df`) — **decision (Nes): venue slider range = `[lowest-bookable-tier-min, current-tier-max]`** (unlocking raises the ceiling, keeps the floor at the smallest real venue). New `VenueCapacityManager.getBookingRangeForTier`; `validateCapacity` + estimate `tierRange` + client fallback route through it.

**C69 discovered incidentally + fixed** (`1db5c39`, backlog `6c9e5a8`): `FinancialSystem.calculateAwarenessGain` called a non-existent `getArtistSync` — threw, was swallowed by a try/catch, and **silently zeroed the entire marketing-driven awareness gain for ~9 months** (pre-existing since 2025-09-26, NOT caused by the revival). Fixed: async `getArtistById`, guarded so a missing accessor degrades to no popularity bonus (×1.0) instead of nuking the gain; dead second call removed; +4 regression tests. Golden master unaffected.

**Design discussions elevated to `[FUTURE]` seed planning docs** (`861d8de`): `[FUTURE] executive-meeting-effect-legibility.md` (explanation / pending-visibility / payoff-attribution gaps on the 14 keys) and `[FUTURE] executive-meeting-relevance-and-reactivity.md` (meetings feel disconnected from label state → the *"you just hit AUTO because it doesn't matter"* root cause; carries a **Tier 0/1/2 scope fork** needing a product decision).

**Playtest doc archived** (`fcdc877`): `PLAYTEST_NOTES_EXEC_MEETINGS_2026-07-04.md` `git mv`-ed to `docs/99-legacy/superseded-2026-07/` with a dated ARCHIVED header; all 5 inbound links fixed (README section move, CLAUDE.md constellation relabel, backlog + both planning-doc origin refs).

**Ops note:** the dev server runs plain `tsx` (NOT watch) — server/engine fixes are invisible until a restart. The server WAS restarted mid-session, so all fixes are now live for continued playtesting.

**Decisions (Nes):** all playtest fixes land on PR #119 (no new branches); venue range = lowest-min→current-max; C69 logged-then-fixed on request; design docs = seed depth (not full plans); archive the playtest doc now.

**📋 Doc-governance check (this session):**
- **Archival convention** — ✅ PASS (playtest doc archived correctly, links fixed in the same commit).
- **Placement** — ✅ PASS (2 new `[FUTURE]` docs in `implementation-specs/` with `[STATUS]` prefix).
- **Reference-doc freshness** — ✅ PASS (`actions.json`/`LIVE_EFFECT_KEYS` did NOT change → exec-meetings `[REFERENCE]` doc unaffected; `[READY]` revival plan stays `[READY]` until the PR merges).
- **Doc-sync rule** — ⚠️ PARTIAL / logged here: most fixes were behavior-RESTORING (code brought in line with already-documented intent). Three are genuine behavior/shape changes whose descriptive workflow docs were NOT updated this session: **C67 venue booking-range rule** + **#12 tour-completion net profit** (→ `docs/03-workflows/tour-system-workflows.md`) and the **popularity/talent field on `ready-for-release`** (→ `docs/03-workflows/plan-release-system-workflows.md`). Logged as an open thread rather than silently orphaned — fold into a future docs pass or the merge.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **PR #119 still UNMERGED** — carries the full revival + 12 playtest fixes + C69. One merge at the end, Nes's call.
- Reconcile the 3 workflow-doc staleness items above (doc-sync rule) — small, defer-able.
- The relevance/reactivity `[FUTURE]` doc needs Nes's **Tier 0/1/2 decision** before it can become a real plan.
- After merge: rename `[READY] executive-meetings-revival-plan.md` → `[COMPLETE]` + move to `COMPLETED/`; then the deferred slices (success/failure rolls, side events — events.json is key-clean).
- Still open from prior sessions: phantom side-events system; backlog C58/C60/C62/C66/C67; Phase 4 audio audition.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3–4, 2026 (Executive Meetings Revival EXECUTED: 9 PRs, 71 dead keys → 0 — PR #119 open, UNMERGED pending playtest)

**The full revival plan (`docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/[READY] executive-meetings-revival-plan.md`) was executed end-to-end in one orchestrated session** — orchestrator + one fresh subagent per PR (Sonnet for scoped builds, Opus for PR-5/PR-8/PR-9 judgment work) + a fresh-context verifier after every phase. All work is on branch **`feat/exec-meetings-revival`** (17 commits, `39ad919` → `4d140c9`), opened as **PR #119**. **Merge policy per Nes: ONE merge at the end, and NOT yet — playtest first.** Local `main` carries the (unpushed) docs-trio commit `43f9570`, which rides inside the PR.

**Planning docs produced first (same session, earlier):** `docs/98-research/EXECUTIVE_MEETINGS_CASE_FILE_2026-07-03.md` (validated 62-choice map + wiring surface; corrected several gap-analysis counts), `docs/98-research/EXEC_MEETINGS_EFFECT_KEY_DISPOSITIONS_2026-07-03.md` (71 dead keys → 6 channels + map/delete, Opus-designed, orchestrator-validated), and the 9-PR plan.

**Shipped (all on the branch, every PR gated by orchestrator diff-review + own test runs):**
- **PR-1 `39ad919`** — truth infrastructure: delayed-effect flag-key bug fixed (`details?.choiceId` was always undefined), `LIVE_EFFECT_KEYS` export + unknown-key `default:` warn in `applyEffects`, `TEST_mood_boost_immediate` removed from prod data, real Zod choice schema (loader now throws outside production).
- **PR-2 `2161cb1` + `bb92c0b`** — badge honesty: every badge renderer (DialogueInterface, SelectionSummary, WeekSummary meetings card, ArtistDialogueModal) whitelists through `LIVE_EFFECT_KEYS`; new WeekSummary meetings bucket/card surfaces meetings, exec loyalty decay (promoted to notable via new `loyaltyChange` discriminator), and delayed-effect payoffs; meeting change entries enriched (`meetingId`/`choiceId`/`choiceLabel`/`appliedEffects`).
- **PR-3 `6d53aae`** — C2 press channel: `press_story_flag` (one-shot, consumed+cleared by next release's press roll, +30% pickup chance) and `press_momentum` (accumulating pool, +2%/point pickup chance) live; 3 data normalizations incl. the `media_skepticism` sign flip.
- **PR-4 `bb6bd4d`** — C1 quality channel: `quality_bonus` banks in `flags.pendingQualityBonus`, applies additively to ALL songs in the next generating week then zeroes (8-week expiry); `rush`/`release_as_is` traps real; 5 keys folded in.
- **PR-5 `966dbe1`** — C3 awareness channel: `awareness_boost` seeds the next release's per-song awareness (×8/point) riding the already-live awareness economy; 17 choices normalized; **Spotify/Apple/simultaneous rebalanced into a genuine trilemma** (data-driven non-dominance test); first player-facing awareness readout (Buzz chip in SongCatalog).
- **PR-6 `8569e66`** — C4 variance channel: `variance_up` widens the next session's quality band (+50%/point) + outlier tails; `rep_swing` = deterministic isolated-seeded reputation gamble; **AUTO-select upgraded from always-`choices[0]` to a risk-averse scorer** (never gambles when a safe choice exists).
- **PR-7 `f1778bd`** — C5 award track: `award_chances` banks forever → isolated seeded award roll at campaign end (8%/point, cap 80%, +2000 score, Winner/Nominee achievements, CampaignResultsModal cell); **the dead `hit_single_bonus`/`number_one_bonus` config finally wired** — first Top-10 entry +5 rep, first #1 +10, once per song via `flags.chartMilestones`.
- **PR-8 `1644438`** — content sweep (Opus): the last 24 dead keys mapped/deleted per the disposition worksheet (`digital_focus` trap fixed via `artist_popularity: -2`); `executive_mood` authored into 12 non-CEO choices (C6); `cmo_pr_angle`/`distribution_pitch` re-authored into distinct strategies; `events.json` made key-clean for future side-event wiring; **data-lint forever-guard** (every authored key must be canonical) + **no-dominant-choice regression test** (caught and fixed 3 real dominance violations).
- **PR-9 `ba80f86` + `1d84428`/`8d98d04`** — exec mood modifiers: ONE pure shared util (`shared/utils/executiveMoodModifier.ts`) used by engine AND client Impact Preview (mood <30 ⇒ costs ×1.25; >80 ⇒ ×0.90; >90 ⇒ non-money effects ×1.20; CEO exempt; delayed effects scaled at queue time); ExecutiveCard band chips; parity drift-guard test (progression.json knobs ≡ util defaults); cultivation loop DB-proven ($4,000 meeting → $5,000 at mood 20).

**Verifier-driven fix batches (every phase verifier found real bugs the builders' green tests missed):** `bb92c0b` (WeekSummary meetings card itself rendered dead-key badges via raw delayed-effect payloads; ArtistDialogueModal unguarded), `daf7cfe` (negative momentum snapped to 0 in one week instead of fading), `2b6f28e` (**apply-then-decay erosion**: momentum landing via delayed effects was decayed in the same `processDelayedEffects` call, making every ±1 momentum choice a provable no-op — decay now runs BEFORE the entry loop; `pressStoryFlag` gained the missing expiry), `8d98d04` (rep_swing-under-inspired regression test).

**CI failure root-caused post-push:** PR #119's vitest job failed — `DatabaseStorage.updateExecutive` was the ONE storage method using the module-global `db` (`transaction || db`) instead of the injected instance (`|| this.db`), so PR-9's DB-backed test hit the SSL-configured production pool in CI. Fixed in `4d140c9` (pushed; **CI re-run is the verification** — the local test run was skipped at session wrap).

**Numbers:** suites 776 → **1,013 tests** (678 server + 335 client), tsc clean at every commit; golden master's ONLY delta across the entire branch is PR-2's documented additive meeting fields + importance flip; 14 canonical live effect keys; zero dead keys in actions/events/dialogue.json (independently audited); all 6 free-money traps proven non-dominant by test.

**Decisions (Nes):** one merge at the end (no per-PR merges); disposition worksheet adopted as-is for PR-8 content values (no checkpoint); session docs ride the feature PR (this entry); **merge deferred until playtest**.

**New debt:** C66 (loose non-actions Zod loaders, verbose engine debug logging, stale `actions.json.backup`). Deferred by design, do NOT build casually: mood availability gates (<20/<10), Level/XP, success/failure rolls, combo actions.

**Docs workstream addendum (July 4, same branch):** produced the canonical **`[REFERENCE] executive-meetings-system-complete-reference.md`** (`fcc177a` — 20 meetings × 59 choices with live values, 14 channels, mood bands, guardrails; linked from docs/CLAUDE.md). Two staleness audits then established that the Phase 0→4 arc had left descriptive docs badly stale (Passport-auth/month-cadence fossils survived ~10 months). Cleanup pass 1 (`9aeb1e6`): archived 4 pre-refactor docs to **`docs/99-legacy/superseded-2026-07/`** with dated superseded-headers (api-design, frontend-architecture, music-creation-architecture, plan-release-api-spec), rewrote backend-architecture.md's contradictory body, fixed the /onboard-facing fragments. Pass 2 (`62ffa57`): status headers on the three 2026-07-03 research docs (dispositions PROPOSAL→ADOPTED), archived 2 more exec docs, fixed two code-verified false claims (artist_energy is NOT display-only; artists never had a loyalty column), and **codified the rules**: documentation-governance.md gains formal *Archival Mechanism* + *Doc-Sync Rule* sections; root/client/data CLAUDE.mds carry the doc-sync, badge-whitelist, exec-mood-parity, and effect-key authoring rules; `/session-end` gained a governance-compliance step (`07bb796`). CI storage fix `4d140c9` (updateExecutive instance-db fallback) verified — **PR #119 fully green**.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Nes: playtest `feat/exec-meetings-revival`** (dev server left running on it; Docker test DB up on 5433) — meeting badges, WeekSummary meetings card, press/quality/awareness/variance/award consequences, exec mood chips, AUTO behavior. Channel magnitudes are balance-JSON knobs if anything feels off (tuning `exec_mood_modifiers` requires updating `DEFAULT_EXEC_MOOD_MODIFIER_CONFIG` — tripwire test enforces).
- **Standing decision (Nes, July 4): all playtest-driven fixes land on this same branch/PR #119** — no new branches until the one merge at the end.
- After merge: move the plan doc to `COMPLETED/` (per the /session-end governance check), then the deferred slices (success/failure rolls is the natural next act; PR-6's variance vocabulary now exists) and side events (unblocked — events.json is key-clean).
- Carried over: Nes still owes the Phase 4 audio audition.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Interactivity Gap Analysis: adversarially-verified case file on hollow simulation; read-only, docs-only)

**A dedicated hunting session produced `docs/98-research/INTERACTIVITY_GAP_ANALYSIS_2026-07-03.md`** — an evidence-backed, ranked case file on (Track 1) features designed in docs but never wired, and (Track 2) code that runs but doesn't matter to the player. Ran as orchestrator + 6 scout subagents (2 doc-sweeps, 4 engine traces) + 3 adversarial verifiers that attempted to REFUTE every "it's dead" claim before it entered the report (the star_power_amplification false-kill precedent drove this design — and the verifiers DID catch several stale doc claims in the other direction). Every claim is backed by file:line inspected this session; two items are explicitly marked UNVERIFIED rather than asserted.

**Headline findings (consequence-weighted ranking, full detail + effort sizing + constraint collisions in the report):**
1. **Random side events are a phantom system** — 20% weekly roll (`game-engine.ts:966-980`) picks fully-authored multi-choice events from `data/events.json`, then discards everything: effects never applied, choices never presented, title never rendered.
2. **71 of 77 executive-meeting effect keys are silent no-ops** — `ActionProcessor.applyEffects` handles 6 keys with no default case, while BOTH badge renderers (DialogueInterface, SelectionSummary) promise every key to the player. Produces fake choices, free-money traps (e.g. apple_exclusive strictly dominates), and 7 all-payoff-dead meetings. S-size mitigation available (badge whitelist) independent of the L-size real wiring.
3. **`WeekSummary.tsx` `categorizeChanges` has an unrendered `other` bucket** swallowing 8 change types — including `breakthrough`, which `changeImportance.ts` classifies as HERO. One S-size UI fix un-hides several systems.
4. **The awareness economy is fully live and completely invisible** — up to 2× weekly streams (`FinancialSystem.ts:983-1013`, enabled), zero player UI (admin StreamingDecayTester only). **Backlog C42 was factually wrong** and now carries a correction note; C43 was half-wrong (DELETE-release endpoint exists server-side with safe refund; only the UI button is missing).
5. **Artist energy is display-only** (read by nothing), dialogue scene mood/energy targeting is unread (scenes picked at random), exec Level is hardcoded 1 forever, exec mood/loyalty gate nothing, charts feed nothing back (hit_single/number_one rep bonuses are dead config), reputation never decays, difficulty system has no UI and ¾ dead modifiers, achievements score on 3 of 5 axes with a mid-tier-only "Media Mogul" equality bug.

**Also produced:** a "not worth it" section (roles table = delete-not-wire; artist loyalty = deliberately refactored away; two superseded planning docs to archive), a corrected-stale-claims ledger (C40/C42/C43/C44/C45 + several planning-doc claims), and a per-finding constraint cheat-sheet (golden master / SNAPSHOT_VERSION / atomic-week / seeded-RNG collisions).

**Tech debt logged (C60–C65):** delayed artist_energy/popularity effects hit the whole roster ignoring artistId (medium); tier downgrades announce "Upgraded"; AchievementsEngine hardcoded-zero components + equality bug + 12-week copy rot (medium); dead artist columns (massAppeal/stress/creativity/moodHistory/lastMoodEvent/moodTrend) + phantom `artist.loyalty` client fallbacks; side-event roll uses unseeded Math.random; release press path writes reputation uncapped. Backlog header counts updated; C42/C43 stale-premise correction note added.

**Decisions made (Nes):** ranking lens = consequence-weighted; full Track 2 sweep; deliverable = files only (committed at session wrap, no fixes applied — read-only mission honored).

**Coordination note:** the parallel Phase 4 session merged #113–#118 mid-flight; the report's Phase-4 and modal-race bullets were reconciled against that before commit (notable-chime now wired; `warning` deliberately unwired; auto-open reworked — re-verify the stacked-modal race before scoping the XState orchestrator).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Nes: pick from the report's ranked list.** The zero-engine-risk first wave is findings 3 (render the `other`/hero bucket), 4 (awareness surfacing), 9 (difficulty picker), 11 (cancel-release button), 14 (email CTAs), plus the meeting-badge whitelist from finding 2.
- **C60 and C62 are S-size real bugs** worth folding into any nearby PR.
- Two UNVERIFIED items if anyone wants closure: legacy no-releaseId song path reachability; whether "Industry Legend" (200 rep) is strictly impossible.
- The report's corrected-stale-claims ledger should be applied to the source planning docs (C42/C43 backlog notes already annotated).

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Phase 4 COMPLETE: game feel — planned, executed, live-verified in one session; PRs #100, #102, #109, #112–#117)

**Phase 4 (game feel) went from "no tickets" to fully planned, built, merged, and live-verified**, running as orchestrator + one subagent per PR (Opus for high-risk/engine-adjacent, Sonnet for scoped builds), concurrent worktrees, orchestrator diff-review before every merge, self-merge-on-green-CI per session grant. Ran in parallel with (and coordinated live against) the Phase 3.5 + D6 session below — Phase 4's WeekSummary/GameHeader PRs were explicitly gated on 3.5 landing and started the hour the gate opened.

**Plan**: `implementation-specs/COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] phase-4-game-feel-plan.md` — 7 PRs anchored on the week-advance moment, from a two-explorer recon (UX flow map + game-feel toolkit inventory). Scope decisions from Nes: full pass, sound IN, server-side `importance` field OK.

**Shipped (all merged to `main`, CI green incl. the 3.5 grep-gate):**
- **PR-1 #100** — `AnimatedNumber` motion primitive (static on first mount by design; animates on value change) + MetricsDashboard adoption.
- **PR-2 #102** — `shared/utils/changeImportance.ts`: deterministic hero/notable/routine classifier, exhaustive over all 19 `GameChange` types (`assertNever` compile guard); optional additive `importance` on `GameChange`/`ChartUpdate`; ONE engine call site at WeekSummary assembly. Golden-master diff independently audited: 67 added lines, all `importance`, zero deletions (26/12/29 hero/notable/routine); run-twice stable.
- **#109** — six ElevenLabs stings (user-generated in their account via browser automation, user-auditioned favorites, downloaded + renamed) in `client/public/audio/` with `CREDITS.md` provenance (prompts + license basis).
- **PR-6 #112** — sound foundation: `client/src/lib/audio.ts` (plain HTMLAudioElement, autoplay-safe unlock-on-gesture, never-throws, persisted mute/volume default ON at 0.4), dock More-menu Switch+Slider control, store-level wiring with priority pick (campaign-end > hero-fanfare > tier-unlock > week-advance — one sting per week, no pile-up).
- **PR-3 #113** — **the centerpiece**: staged WeekSummary reveal (entrance → net-income count-up → revenue → "Milestone Moments" hero card with tier unlocks MOVED INTO the modal + No. 1s → notable → routine; 1.8s total, click-anywhere skip, reduced-motion instant). `useStagedReveal` timeline hook (deliberately not XState). `unlockToasts.tsx` deleted (grep-verified single caller; modal hero placement supersedes). **Review caught two animation-defeating bugs pre-merge**: (1) count-up never played (AnimatedNumber is static on first mount; fixed by driving 0→value post-mount) and (2) `RevealGroup` defined inside the component (new identity per render → subtree remounts → transitions snapped instead of animating; fixed by hoisting to module scope). Both invisible to jsdom — caught by diff review.
- **PR-4 #114** — anticipation beat: charged shimmer/pulse button while advancing + `WeekTransition` full-screen interstitial ("ADVANCING TO WEEK N", HoloDisc spin-up; 700ms min display so fast responses don't flash, never gates data, pointer-events none, 10s safety dismiss, reduced-motion renders nothing). Agent's own fake-timer tests caught a min-display-timer cancellation bug mid-build.
- **PR-5 #115** — celebration tier: `ParticleBurst` SVG primitive (no new dep, no RNG — hashed per-index scatter; reduced-motion baked in), No. 1 burst over the hero card, `notable-chime` wired at the notable stage (skip/instant-suppressed; `warning` left unwired — no clean trigger), CampaignResultsModal staged (score count-up, staggered cells, entry burst, click-to-skip).
- **PR-7 #116** — HoloDisc `pulse` prop (`ds-ring` halo, caller-owned duration) + CommandDock triggers: ~6s on a hero/notable week, ~1s on action selection. Fixed a pre-existing missing React import in CommandDock (first-ever direct test render).
- **#117** — **the live pass found a 10-month-old bug**: WeekSummary auto-open NEVER fired — `weeklyOutcome.week === currentWeek - 1` while the engine stamps `summary.week` = the week advanced TO and increments `currentWeek` to the same value (`game-engine.ts:156,172`) → mathematically always false, dead since the Sept 2025 month→week conversion (`8e5cdbe`), masked by the old toasts (removed in #113, which made this fix load-bearing). Fixed to `=== currentWeek`.

**Live verification (dev server + real browser, evidence screenshots in-session):** advance click → charged button → WeekTransition interstitial captured mid-flight → modal AUTO-OPENED (post-#117) → net-income count-up observed mid-spring (-$2,396) and settled (-$20,167) → Milestone Moments hero card glowing with a NEW ACCESS UNLOCKED entry → HoloDisc dock pulse visible on both triggers. Player's real save protected: preview-browser run used a manual backup ("phase4-preview-backup wk12") and was restored after; user-browser run used the existing Midnight Records test game. NOT verified by ear: the stings audible-in-practice check — Nes should confirm audio while playing. Gotcha for future preview passes: the preview tab reports `visibilityState: hidden`, so rAF-driven springs freeze — motion verification needs a real visible browser tab (claude-in-chrome), not the preview harness.

**Decisions made:** full-pass scope + sound in scope + engine `importance` field (Nes, session start); sound assets = ElevenLabs generation over CC0 packs (Nes auditioned + starred winners); default sound ON at low volume; `warning` sting deliberately unwired; taste rule enforced in review ("annoying on the 30th week" = blocking).

**Suite:** 774 → ~800+ (every PR added tests; client suite alone grew ~60 tests incl. reveal characterization, fake-timer transition tests, audio-manager unit tests, holo-disc/CommandDock pulse tests). `tsc` clean throughout.

**Post-wrap playtest round (same day, Nes at the keyboard):** Nes ran the UX checklist live and reported two issues, both fixed and merged as **#118** (`4ce8d9a`) within the hour: (1) the HoloDisc action-selection pulse was unreadably subtle and the halo looked off-center (the dock's glass panel was occluding it — it sat at `-z-10` behind ancestor backgrounds) → the disc now spins ~4x faster while pulsing (the readable signal) with a brighter transform-centered halo at `z-0`; (2) the results modal re-popped every time the player navigated back to the dashboard → the auto-open dedupe moved from Dashboard component state (resets on remount) to a one-shot `weeklyOutcomeAutoShow` store flag (set only by `advanceWeek`, consumed on first show, explicitly false on load/restore/new-game, not persisted). Both user-verified live before merge.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Nes: audio audition** — play a few weeks with sound on; tune per-sting volume/selection if anything grates (assets swap trivially in `client/public/audio/`).
- **C56** (façade selector re-render bail-out) unchanged — became relevant to animation code; PR-3/4 worked around it via local state per the sanctioned pattern.
- **C58** (advance-week idempotency guard, from the D6 handoff) — good companion for any future GameHeader work; not done this session.
- Phase 4 plan doc moved to COMPLETED; the scaling arc (Phase 0 → 4) is now **fully complete**.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Phase 3.5 + D6 COMPLETE: PRs #98–#111 minus Phase 4's, orchestrator + subagent factory)

**Phase 3.5 (gameState → TanStack Query) AND D6 (whole-week transaction atomicity) both planned and fully executed in one orchestrated session** — same pattern as Phases 1–3: planner agents first, one implementation agent per PR in isolated worktrees, adversarial reviewer on every med-high-risk PR, CI-gated self-merge (user-granted this session). All merged to `main` (final: `73cb031`). Ran concurrently with the parallel Phase 4 session (PRs #100/#102/#109 landed mid-flight; coordinated via relayed constraints, no conflicts).

**D6 — the week advance is now ONE atomic transaction (PRs #101, #105, #107):**
- **#101** — failure-injection characterization: injectable-deps tests pinning the OLD broken behavior (crash between tx1/tx2 → half-applied week; error during tx1 → escaping artist-mood write survives rollback). Found in planning: the "two-transaction split" understated it — `updateArtist` had no tx param and `updateProject` silently dropped its tx arg, so artist/project/release writes escaped BOTH transactions (autocommit).
- **#105** — threaded `dbTransaction` through 11 storage methods + ~30 call sites; Test B flipped (escapes now roll back). Adversarial review: sound; golden master byte-identical.
- **#107** — merged tx2 into tx1 (one `db.transaction` for the whole advance, statement order verbatim) + `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the game row (concurrent advances serialize; new concurrency test proves it). Test A flipped: crash at the worst-case point → TOTAL rollback (songs/emails/charts, tour stats, release flags, artist mood, week, money). Review found one MEDIUM (config JSON loads + Zod ran inside the row lock every advance) — fixed pre-merge by hoisting above the tx. Golden master 10/10 byte-identical: zero gameplay change.
- Follow-up logged, not built: reject-on-stale-week idempotency guard (**C58**).

**Phase 3.5 — the TanStack cache is the single owner of the gameState spine (PRs #98, #99, #103, #104, #106, #108, #110, #111):**
- **#98** — spine characterization net (35 pins: slot math, advanceWeek merge quirk incl. refetch-beats-response precedence, adoptServerBalances, orphan cleanup, snapshot assembly input).
- **#99** — deleted the dead `updateGameState` three-way fallback (zero call sites, independently verified; removed a latent musicLabel-clobber bug).
- **#103/#104** — `useGameState()`/`useGameState(selector)`/`useGameId()` façade + mechanical migration of ALL ~36 spine-reader files (23 components/hooks, 11 pages, 2 stragglers the plan's inventory missed). CI caught a co-located-test blind spot (`ArtistRoster.test.tsx` selector-blind store mock) — fixed; lesson institutionalized: validate with `npx vitest run tests/client client/src`, both paths.
- **#106** — `['gameState:record', gameId]` key + `commitGameState()` funnel; all 12 store write sites dual-write Zustand + `setQueryData`; cache≡store pinned after every action.
- **#108** — THE FLIP: façade reads the query cache. Implementer discovered the plan's mechanism was wrong (RQ v5 `notifyManager` batches `useQuery` notifications → breaks same-tick slot math) and used the sanctioned alternative: `useSyncExternalStore` directly on the QueryCache; same-tick property proven by RTL test. Adversarial review: ship-worthy; two non-blocking notes logged (**C56** selector bail-out, **C57** cold-fallback edge).
- **#110** — retired the Zustand copy: store keeps only a `{ id }` session pointer; `readGameState()` serves imperative reads (guards, saveGame, SaveGameModal); snapshot shape FROZEN (`SNAPSHOT_VERSION` still 2, `musicLabel` sibling verified); localStorage partialize byte-identical. Adversarial review traced save/export integrity end-to-end: clean, no circular test pins.
- **#111** — client/CLAUDE.md ownership rewrite, stale-comment sweep, **grep-gate test** (`gameState-ownership.grepgate.test.ts`) permanently enforcing the façade rule, all 10 plan acceptance criteria verified + checked off.

**Decisions made:** self-merge on green CI (session grant); D6 strictly all-or-nothing (no staged fallback); Phase 3.5 goes to full Zustand retirement (no permanent dual-write); legacy localStorage persist shape kept (no version bump); golden-master drift rule (root-cause per field or stop — result: zero unexplained drift all session).

**Tech debt logged (C55–C59, `c2052df`):** engine swallows email-creation errors (found by D6 failure injection); façade selector re-render bail-out; cold-cache fallback 404 edge; advance-week idempotency guard (medium); triage of the ~21 itemized discovered-debt findings in the two plan docs' §7.

**Verification:** baseline 776/776 before any change; every PR merged on green CI (vitest + Playwright); isolated full-suite runs during D6 hit 851–852 passing; plan docs (incl. Phase 3's, retroactively) moved to `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] …`.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Phase 4 (game feel) is UNBLOCKED and already resumed** (parallel session, `feat/phase4-pr3-staged-reveal`). Its rules: spine reads via the façade only; record writes via store actions only; validate both test paths.
- **C58** (advance-week idempotency guard) is the one medium-priority follow-up from this session.
- **C59**: triage the two plan docs' §7 discovered-debt lists (~21 items with file:line refs).
- Docker test DB (`music-label-test-db`, port 5433) left RUNNING for the Phase 4 session.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Full v2 website redesign: "Neo-Cyber HUD", 10 packages → PR #97)

**The entire client was redesigned to the Design System v2 ("neo-cyber HUD": dark indigo #070610, glass panels, chromatic hairlines, spectral neon accents, glow-based depth) imported from the user's claude.ai/design project.** Developed locally on worktree branch `claude/adoring-solomon-db2391`, then pushed as **PR #97** on user approval (merge on green CI granted). Ran as orchestrator + 9 concurrent package agents (Fable/Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) with strict disjoint file ownership in one shared worktree; every package audited against tool evidence before its commit. Post-review live-feedback rounds folded in: stat scale 26→20px, outline-button variant fix, chart row glow removal, dock rebalance + reorder, header declutter (stacked AUTO/Advance Week), true radial splash menu with grooved vinyl, and the real `liquid-chrome-bg.jpg` asset (user-supplied) committed.

**Commits (in order):** `472c640` design refs/spec/inventory docs → `e30395f` Phase 1 token foundation → `29d5754` D splash/menu → `330d397` A Command Dock shell → `281f690` E2a Plan Release → `868ad36` C artist surfaces → `c1a2d2c` G admin pass → `db81644` E2b sessions/tours/charts → `23120d7` E1 exec+A&R → `6bf39bf` F modals/emails → `5dfbe4e` B dashboard widgets → `f41f725` gradient token normalization → (this docs commit).

**What changed:**
- **Phase 1 foundation**: `tailwind.config.ts` v2 palette (`surface-*`, `neon-*`, `positive/negative/warning/money`, radii 16/13/9, glow shadows, `ds-*` keyframes; legacy `brand-*` remapped to v2 hues), `index.css` CSS vars + `.glass-panel`/`.chromatic-hairline`/`.hud-ticks`/`.backdrop-*`/`.text-aberration`/`.shimmer-bar` + reduced-motion support, fonts trimmed to Inter/JetBrains Mono/Major Mono Display, 14 shadcn primitives restyled, new `HoloDisc` + `PageBackdrop` primitives.
- **Navigation replaced**: `GameSidebar.tsx` DELETED → floating `CommandDock.tsx` (center holo-disc home, More overflow, Clerk UserButton, migrated modals + AUTO focus filler) + `GameHeader.tsx` (balance/week/Advance Week). Full feature-mapping table in the Package A agent report; one dead-code deletion (unreachable sidebar New Game flow).
- **All player surfaces restyled** (directional fidelity, zero logic changes): dashboard widgets, artist pages/tabs/cards/dialogue, exec suite + A&R, Plan Release, Recording, Live Performance, Top 100 charts, Office empty state, splash/landing/menu, all modals + 9 email templates. Admin/dev pages got a mechanical dark-theme token pass.
- **Design references archived**: `docs/04-frontend/design/v2/` (8 HTML comps + distilled `design-system-v2.md` spec + `redesign-inventory.md`). CLAUDE.md color section + client/CLAUDE.md nav section updated.

**Verification (evidence in-session):** `npm run check` clean at every package commit and at the end; **full vitest 774/774 passing** (68 files, Docker test DB); live visual smoke on the dev server — MainMenu, Dashboard, Artists, Plan Release, Executive Suite all render v2 with **zero console errors**; SaveGameModal export logic verified byte-untouched via diff-hunk audit; test-pinned strings/classes (access-tier tests, ArtistSelector `text-green-500` helpers, export toasts) preserved.

**Decisions made:**
- User pre-answers: tokens-first approach; ADOPT the Command Dock nav (replacing sidebar); directional fidelity; ALL surfaces in scope; worktree-local first, GitHub push + merge-on-green-CI granted later in session.
- `liquid-chrome-bg.jpg` could not be imported (claude.ai/design API 256KB cap; file is 425KB) — user supplied it; committed to `client/public/`, all backdrop layers pick it up automatically. Logged as **C54** (resolved same-day; appears as "C51" in earlier commit messages — renumbered when main's own C51 landed in parallel).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- New backlog items C52 (chartUtils/marketingUtils still emit v1 classes/FA strings), C53 (redesign leftovers: ChartPerformanceCard light variant, dead widget code, double `max-w` containers).
- Deferred by design: mobile/responsive polish of the dock on narrow screens was styled per mockup (desktop-first) — worth a hands-on pass on small viewports.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Phase 3 COMPLETE + backlog cleared: PRs #87–#96, C26/C49 fixed, C32/C42/C43 dispositioned, show-booking regression fixed live)

**Phase 3 (client state ownership) planned AND executed in one orchestrated session, plus the tech-debt backlog fully dispositioned.** Ran as orchestrator + subagent factory (one Opus/Sonnet agent per PR in isolated worktrees, adversarial reviewer subagent on every med-high-risk PR before merge, fresh-context verifier at the end). Merge policy this session: user-granted self-merge on green CI. Everything below is merged to `main` (final: `0885ff0` + docs commits); full suite **774/774** (was 696), `tsc` clean, CI green on `main`'s own push runs.

**Backlog work (all merged):**
- **C49 ✅** (`2b57880`) — `loadGameFromSave` now invalidates `EMAIL_LIST_SCOPE`/`EMAIL_UNREAD_SCOPE` keyed on the server-confirmed `restoredGameId` (covers overwrite + fork; both SaveGameModal call sites funnel through it). Regression-tested in the Phase 3 client net.
- **C26 ✅** (PR #89) — `ArtistPage.tsx` **1,180 → 369 lines**; five tabs + `PerformanceMetrics` extracted as `React.memo` components under `client/src/components/artist/` with the page's first-ever tests (12 render smokes). Independent review confirmed byte-identical JSX and verified every dead-code deletion against pre-refactor main. Avatar-crop block untouched.
- **C32 ⏸️ deferred with teeth** — cap quantified as unreachable (~100–500 emails per 52-week campaign vs the 10,000 cap; no per-artist/per-song weekly email loops exist — three independent scouts agreed); the dead-write `truncated` flag is now surfaced as an export toast (`8669235`). Saves-list warning would need a server change (out of scope).
- **C42/C43 ⏸️** — explicitly deferred by product decision (user call at session start); annotated in the backlog.
- **C50 🆕 logged** — `tests/client/` jsdom tests carry an incidental Docker-DB dependency via the shared `tests/setup.ts` `beforeAll`; low, not scheduled.
- Deleted the stale `_tmp-advance-week-timing.test.ts` scratch diagnostic.

**Phase 3 (PRs #87–#96, plan doc: `[READY] phase-3-client-state-ownership-plan.md`):**
- **PR-1 #87** — client characterization net (`tests/client/`): gameStore action pins, snapshot-shape pin, and a **query-key contract test** (every store invalidation must match a real hook key) with 5 red pins via `it.fails`.
- **PR-3 #88** — fixed the four dead `['*-roi']` invalidations (real keys have the scope at element 1) + removed the dead `['executives']` one; red pins flipped green. The stale guidance in `client/CLAUDE.md` that prescribed the dead keys was corrected too.
- **PR-4 #90** — the byte-identical 6-endpoint fan-out copied across `loadGame`/`loadGameFromSave`/`advanceWeek` collapsed into one `fetchGameBundle`.
- **PR-5 #92 / PR-8 #91** — `useCharts` and `useExecutives` hooks (ran in parallel; #92 rebased over #91's contract-test edits — keep-both conflicts only). Executives: machine stays injection-pure via an `ensureQueryData`-backed injected fetch; thin store copy kept as sanctioned snapshot input.
- **PR-6 #93 / PR-7 #94 / PR-9 #95** — `useReleases`+`useSongs`, `useProjects`, `useArtists`+`useDiscoveredArtists`: the store stopped owning all server collections; the fan-out seeds the query caches (`setQueryData`, zero extra requests); mutations invalidate. Projects/artists have no dedicated GET endpoints, so their queryFns select from `/api/game/:id` (client-only phase, no server changes). Reviewer on #95 caught a real regression — the A&R 404 short-circuit lost in the retry path — fixed pre-merge (`4047121`). The discovered-artists client-persistence worry was disproven: the persist partialize never included them; the server flags array is the source of truth.
- **PR-10 #96** — the drift fix the phase existed for: `signArtist`/`createProject`/`planRelease` no longer do client-side money/creativeCapital arithmetic; they adopt server balances via `adoptServerBalances` refetch (none of the three endpoints return balances — verified in server code). Pins now use server numbers that differ from what client math would compute, plus a double-fire no-compounding test.
- **PR-2 of the plan was dropped** — obsoleted by the C49 fix landing before planning finished (its test survives in PR-1).
- **Fresh-context verifier: MEETS SPEC** — all 8 §4 acceptance criteria pass with independently observed evidence; the only find was a stale header counter in the backlog doc (fixed).

**Decisions made:**
- Session grants (via AskUserQuestion at start): self-merge on green CI; plan-and-execute Phase 3 continuously; C42 + C43 deferred.
- `client/CLAUDE.md` State Management + Cache Management sections rewritten to describe the Phase 3 ownership model (the "Persisted" list had never matched the actual partialize).

**Post-wrap live smoke (same day, user at the keyboard):** started the dev server and played the game hands-on. Found a real regression — **booking a show/tour had been silently broken since PR #68** (July 2): the create-project hardening schema required `songCount > 0`, but `LivePerformancePage` has always sent `songCount: 0` for tours, so every booking 400'd with "Invalid project data". NOT a Phase 3 regression (client payload unchanged; the earlier smoke pass created a Single, never a tour, so it slipped through). Fixed server-side (`4b07e07`): `songCount` is now `nonnegative` with a refine keeping the ≥1 requirement for Single/EP; two regression tests added (the real tour payload → 200 + correct charge; Single with 0 → still 400); projects-create suite 13/13. **User confirmed booking works live.** Also found during play: the "On Tour" artist badge lags the tour's COMPLETE status by exactly one week (engine advances tour stage with `>` not `>=` on cities played; badge reads `stage === 'production'`) — logged as **C51** with root-cause file refs and two fix options, not fixed.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Deferred from Phase 3** (plan §3 footnote): full `gameState`→TanStack migration (the spine, read in ~30 files) — a "Phase 3.5" candidate; `updateGameState` three-way fallback; orphan-cleanup path.
- **Phase 4 (game feel)** still has no tickets; first candidate remains the staged WeekSummary reveal.
- **D6** whole-week transaction atomicity — still a filed idea.
- ~~Manual smoke of the Phase 3 surface~~ — **done live same day** (see post-wrap smoke above): booking, week advance, tour completion all exercised; found the pre-existing booking bug + C51.
- Backlog: 51 items — 46 completed, 3 deferred by decision (C32/C42/C43), 2 pending (C50 client-test DB coupling, C51 On-Tour badge lag; both low).

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (PR #86 merged, manual smoke pass, native-dialog UX sweep, C49)

**Picked up the previous session's unmerged remote work, ran the manual authenticated smoke pass that's been owed since Phase 1, found and fixed a real UX bug it surfaced, then swept the whole client for the same bug class.** Everything below is merged to `main` (`612bb88`), pushed directly per user instruction (no PR).

**Done this session:**
- **Found and merged PR #86** — the prior session's tour/press tech-debt sweep (C41, C44–C48) had been committed and pushed to `origin/claude/onboarding-08l2x6` but never opened as a PR or merged; `main` itself was up to date with `origin/main` so `git pull` reported nothing, which is what surfaced the gap. Verified locally (`tsc` clean, 696/696 tests passing, 0 skipped) before opening and merging **PR #86** (`themightynes/music-label-manager#86`).
- **Ran the manual authenticated smoke pass** owed since Phase 1: signed in, backed up the existing "Sonic Boom Entertainment" save, created a new game ("Midnight Records"), ran an A&R op → discovered and signed an artist, created a Single project, planned its release, advanced through week 4→6, and watched the release execute live — **145,286 plays, 8 press mentions (live proof the C45 fix works), $8,264 earned, reputation 5→22**. Also exercised save/restore: manual save → loaded an older autosave → confirmed state correctly reverted (money/reputation/access tiers) → restored forward to the newer checkpoint → survived a full reload.
- **Found a real bug during the smoke test**: the release-planning success flow used native `alert()`/`confirm()` (Windows-native popups) instead of in-app UI — this also explained why browser automation hung mid-flow (native dialogs block the page and aren't part of the DOM). Fixed `PlanReleasePage.tsx`'s two calls (success → `toast()`, "plan another?" → the existing `ConfirmDialog`), then **swept the entire `client/src` tree** for the same anti-pattern: `FocusSlotStatus.tsx` (A&R cancel-operation → `ConfirmDialog`), `ArtistDiscoveryTable.tsx` (dev-only debug dump → console.log + toast), `ActionsViewer.tsx` admin tool (discard-unsaved-changes → the file's existing `AlertDialog` save-confirmation pattern), plus two more `alert()`s in `PlanReleasePage.tsx` (song-title validation/save-failure → toast). Zero native `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` calls remain in `client/src`. `tsc` clean.
- **Logged Comment 49** (tech-debt backlog): after a save/load restore, the inbox briefly shows stale pre-restore emails until a full page reload. Traced the actual cause — `loadGameFromSave` (`gameStore.ts`) writes `emails` straight into Zustand but never invalidates the `useEmails` TanStack Query cache (`EMAIL_LIST_SCOPE`/`EMAIL_UNREAD_SCOPE`), same family as the previously-fixed week-advance email-invalidation gap. Underlying data is correct immediately; this is a display-only cache-invalidation gap. Refreshed the backlog's summary stats while in there (44 completed / 5 pending / 49 total, up from a stale 47/38/9).
- **Committed and pushed directly to `main`** (`612bb88`) per explicit user instruction — no PR for this batch (UX fix + docs).

**Decisions made:**
- User confirmed: skip the PR/review flow for this batch, commit straight to `main`.
- Smoke test used a fresh new game rather than the existing save, after backing the existing save up first — avoids risk to real progress while still exercising the full new-game → release → restore path.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Comment 49 fix itself is NOT done** — only logged. The actual fix (invalidate `EMAIL_LIST_SCOPE`/`EMAIL_UNREAD_SCOPE` after `loadGameFromSave`) is still open.
- **Backlog remaining (5)**: C49 (new, above), C42 (awareness dead bookkeeping — product decision), C43 (planned releases can't be cancelled/edited), C26 (ArtistPage refactor), C32 (email snapshot cap).
- **Phase 3 (client state ownership) planning** still queued; D6 whole-week transaction atomicity still a filed idea; difficulty UI still unexposed.
- Two untracked local scratch files remain in the working tree (`.claude/launch.json`, `tests/endpoints/_tmp-advance-week-timing.test.ts`) — left alone, not part of any commit this session.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Tech-debt sweep: tour & release preview↔execution parity, C41–C48)

**Cleared every remaining Critical/High/tour-family backlog item in one session — backlog now 44/48 done (0 Critical, 0 High).** All work is on branch **`claude/onboarding-08l2x6`** (5 commits, pushed, **no PR opened yet** — that's the first next step). Remote-container session: no Docker available, so the vitest suite ran against a native PostgreSQL 16 cluster stood up on port 5433 (same `postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/music_label_test` contract as CI).

**Done this session:**
- **C46 ✅** — `POST /api/tour/estimate` now honors an explicit `venueCapacity` for `totalBudget` (via `calculateTourCostsWithCapacity`); tier-RNG draw only as no-capacity fallback. Found the ticket's "display-only" framing was wrong: `LivePerformancePage` passes `totalBudget` back as the tour's charged `totalCost`, so the random draw was leaking into what the player pays. Estimate characterization test now pins `totalBudget`/`canAfford` exactly (old `<rng-derived>` normalization gone).
- **C47 ✅ (two steps)** — first aligned the estimate route's `artistPopularity` default to the engine's `|| 50`; then per product decision changed **both** sides to floor zero/unset popularity to **1** (`artist.popularity || 1`) — a true unknown tours as a nobody, not a mid-tier act. No RNG-stream impact; golden master unaffected (fixture artist is popularity 60). Parity test: popularity-0 ≡ popularity-1 estimates, and popularity-0 revenue < popularity-50 (guards the old default from regressing).
- **C41 ✅** — a tour missing `metadata.venueCapacity` (legacy/imported save) no longer throws in `TourProcessor` and bricks week advancement; falls back to the **deterministic midpoint** of the stored tier's range (clubs → 275). New golden-master scenario `legacy-tour-week` pins it.
- **C48 ✅ (new entry, found+fixed same day)** — `TourProcessor` back-derived the marketing budget via `calculateTourCosts`' hidden random tier-capacity draw, so executed marketing spend drifted from the `budgetPerCity × cities` the player paid. Now extracted against the tour's actual capacity. Removes one RNG draw per tour → golden-master `tour-week` snapshot regenerated (fixture marketing now exactly $6,650/city; was $8,619.80 inflated by a random ~206 capacity). Only the tour scenario shifted; all others byte-identical.
- **C45 ✅** — the backlog's `star_power_amplification`-is-dead claim was **wrong**: it's live in `FinancialSystem.calculateStreamingOutcome` (every release's initial streams) with unit-test coverage — backlog corrected, config kept. The real fix: `weeklyStats.pressMentions` was hardcoded 0 (standing TODO) while MetricsDashboard displays it in 3 places; `WeekSummary.pressMentions` now accumulates pickups from release press coverage (`ReleaseProcessor`) + PR campaigns (`ActionProcessor`). Release-week golden master gained only the new `pressMentions: 8` field.
- **C44 ✅ (was the last High)** — the "two independent calculation paths" premise was **stale**: since Phase 2, `calculateSophisticatedReleaseOutcome` is a thin adapter delegating to `calculateReleasePreview` (one multiplier chain; metadata field names verified write↔read). The real residual divergence: `processPlannedReleases` fetched **the first artist in the game** (`getArtistsByGame(...)[0]`) instead of the release's artist — on multi-artist rosters, execution used the wrong artist's popularity while the preview used the right one. Fixed to `getArtist(release.artistId)`. New golden-master scenario `multi-artist-release-week` pins it (popularity-90 release artist → 232,553 streams vs 156,368 for the popularity-50 fixture); single-artist `release-week` snapshot stayed byte-identical. Accepted inherent preview/execution deltas (RNG draw position, state drift between plan and release week, lead-single split) documented in the backlog resolution.
- **Deleted the 3 skipped pre-flip characterization pins** (A&R pre-pure-read block ×2, artists-PATCH pre-hardening baseline) — their keep-visible-in-the-diff purpose expired when the Phase 2 PRs merged. Suite now **695 passed, 0 skipped**; `tsc` clean.

**Decisions made:**
- Zero/unset artist popularity floors to **1** in tour math, both estimate and engine (`|| 1`, so a genuine popularity-0 artist is no longer silently treated as 50). Sanctioned behavior change, scoped to zero/unset only.
- C41 fallback uses the tier-range **midpoint, not an RNG draw**, so legacy tours can't perturb the seeded stream for other systems.
- `TourProcessor`'s header now carries a POST-EXTRACTION CHANGES log (C47/C41/C48) since the file is no longer character-identical to the extracted original.
- `star_power_amplification` stays — it's live config; the backlog claim was corrected rather than the config deleted.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Open a PR for `claude/onboarding-08l2x6`** (5 commits: C46+C47 estimate fixes, popularity floor, C41/C48/C45 batch, C44, skipped-test cleanup) and merge; then resync `main`.
- **Manual authenticated smoke pass STILL owed** (fourth session running): new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore.
- **Backlog remaining (4)**: C42 (awareness is dead bookkeeping — product decision: wire into streaming multiplier or stop celebrating it), C43 (planned releases can't be cancelled/edited — feature + partial-refund design), C26 (ArtistPage refactor), C32 (email snapshot cap).
- **Phase 3 (client state ownership) planning** still queued; D6 whole-week transaction atomicity still a filed idea; difficulty UI still unexposed.

## 📅 Session Log — July 2, 2026 Late Evening (Phase 2 engine seams: full decomposition, PRs #72–#84)

**Phase 2 (engine seams) is DONE and merged to `main` — the entire 13-PR sequence executed in one session, same orchestrator/subagent factory pattern as Phase 1.** `shared/engine/game-engine.ts` went **5,116 → 1,136 lines**; 8 new processor modules live under `shared/engine/processors/` (~3,900 lines total). The engine is now fully deterministic and covered by a golden-master characterization harness. Suite grew **545 → 692 passing (3 skipped)**.

**Done this session:**
- **PR-1 (#72) — determinism foundation**: seeded every remaining gameplay `Math.random()` call — the song-quality outlier roll, tour attendance variance, and a `FinancialSystem` breakthrough-growth roll the original plan missed — through the seeded RNG. Deleted a dead block that was silently shifting the RNG stream. Switched A&R `discoveryTime` from a wall-clock ISO string to sim-time (`week N`) so save-restore is reproducible. Distribution-verified (outlier rates, variance bounds) before merge.
- **PR-2 (#73) — golden-master harness**: 8 seeded fixture scenarios run `advanceWeek` end-to-end; a normalizer strips UUIDs/timestamps so snapshots are byte-comparable; run-twice stability check confirms determinism. This became the safety net for every extraction PR that followed.
- **PR-3 — `advanceWeekService` extraction**: pulled the orchestration out of `gameLoop.ts` (407 → 75 lines); the two-transaction split moved verbatim (no transactionality changes — that's the filed D6 follow-up).
- **PR-4 — A&R artists GET made a pure read**: deleted an in-GET `Math.random()` write and legacy dual-format branches; `arOffice.ts` 408 → 284 lines.
- **PR-5..11 — the 8 engine processors**, each a verbatim move guarded byte-identical by the golden master, using a new `WeekContext` pattern + `GameEngine.weekContext()` helper: `AROfficeProcessor`, `ProgressionProcessor` + `WeeklyFinancesProcessor`, `TourProcessor`, `SongGenerationProcessor` (+17 quality unit tests — first-ever coverage for the quality formula), `ProjectStageProcessor` (**B6 resolved** — deleted the ~95-line no-op "recorded" pass and wired the previously-never-firing "ready for release" notification; songs are born recorded), `ReleaseProcessor` (the biggest, ~1,250 lines, split across 2 commits), and `ActionProcessor` + `ArtistStateProcessor` (the `applyEffects` coupling hub, extracted last by design).
- **PR-12 — dead code + dead config sweep**: ~440 net lines removed (`quality_bonus`/`segment_slopes` ranges/`quality_per_song_impact`/`project_durations` config keys + their types); stopped the engine writing legacy A&R singular keys (re-sourced a hidden email read along the way to stay byte-identical).
- **PR-13 (#84) — engine-boundary leftovers**: artists PATCH now `.strict()`-whitelisted (`{mood, energy}` only, `INVALID_ARTIST_FIELDS` on violation); removed the stale `defaultRoles` TODO; routed `GET /api/game-state` auto-create through the new `gameCreationService.createBareGame` (**D4** — deliberately the *bare* creation method, not full `createGame`, because `createGame` also seeds a label + executives, which would suppress `GamePage`'s label-creation modal; documented in the PR).

**The one player-visible change:** the B6 fix in PR-9 — the "recording complete, ready for release" notification now actually fires. Everything else in this phase is refactor-only; the plan's three sanctioned behavior changes (seeded-RNG per-seed differences, the B6 notification, the A&R legacy-branch response) are the only intended deltas.

**Decisions made:**
- **D1**: engine stays in `shared/` (server-only in practice, but a move to `server/engine/` is zero-behavior-gain churn; revisit in Phase 3).
- **D6**: whole-week transaction atomicity stays out of scope — the per-step tx boundaries moved verbatim; wrapping the whole week in one transaction is a filed hardening follow-up, not bundled into this phase.
- Determinism (PR-1) and the golden master (PR-2) were treated as the enabling foundation — nothing in PR-3 onward was allowed to move until both landed, since RNG-stream order is behavior and the golden master is what proves a move is verbatim.

**Honest status: everything above is merged to `main`.** No open PRs from this phase.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Manual authenticated smoke pass is STILL owed** (carried over from Phase 1, not done this session either): new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore.
- **Two tour-estimate inconsistencies found during PR-7**, both need a product/behavior decision (logged to the tech-debt backlog this session):
  1. `POST /api/tour/estimate`'s `totalBudget` draws venue-capacity from the tier RNG even when the caller supplies an explicit capacity — display-only today, but makes `canAfford` checks flaky against the actual tour outcome.
  2. `artistPopularity` defaults to `0` in the estimate route but `50` in the engine's actual tour processing — the estimate and the real tour can diverge for the same artist.
- **Whole-week transaction atomicity** (D6 follow-up) — still just a filed idea, not scheduled.
- **Phase 3 (client state ownership) planning can begin.**

## 📅 Session Log — July 2, 2026 Evening (PR-16..18 services + security hardening wave)

**Continued the Phase 1 service-extraction sequence (PR-16, PR-17, PR-18) and, in parallel, ran a security-focused wave off this morning's three `docs/98-research` reviews (RECORDING_SESSION, OWNERSHIP_AUTHORIZATION_SWEEP, AR_OFFICE).** Same orchestrator pattern as the day session: parallel scout subagents plus one mutating agent per checkout, worktree-isolated, characterization-test-first for every behavior-touching PR. **Everything below is merged to `main`** — PR-16 (#61), PR-17 (#63), PR-18 (#64), and the full security wave.

**Done this session:**
- **PR-16 saveService extraction (#61)**: `server/routes/saves.ts` **629 → 139 lines**. New `server/services/saveService.ts` (`createSave`/`restoreOverwrite`/`restoreFork`/`deleteSave`) follows the `AnalyticsService` convention. Characterization-first: `tests/endpoints/save-restore.characterization.test.ts` (11 tests, committed green against the old handler before the swap).
- **Security wave, PR #62**: deleted the two zero-auth routes found by the reviews — `GET /api/debug/game/:gameId/revenue` and `POST /api/select-actions` (the latter already flagged as orphaned/dead in a July 1 follow-up note) — and admin-gated `POST /api/dev/markets-config`.
- **PR-17 releasePlanningService extraction (#63)**: new `server/services/releasePlanningService.ts`; introduced a shared `server/middleware/requireGameOwner.ts` applied to all 12 `:gameId` releases routes; fixed a **live negative-marketing-budget money-credit exploit** in the release-plan handler; added a field whitelist on release create. `server/routes/releases.ts` **908 → 685 lines**.
- **PR-18 artistService extraction (#64, stacked on #63)**: new `server/services/artistService.ts`. `sign-artist` now derives `signingCost`/stats server-side from `data/artists.json` + the discovered pool instead of trusting client-supplied values (closes A&R review finding **B1**); the sign flow is now one atomic transaction (**B2**); roster cap is enforced server-side (**B5**); the dead `signed_artists_count` flags write was deleted (**B6**); ownership checks added on sign/dialogue/mood-events/PATCH artist routes. `server/routes/artists.ts` **317 → 233 lines**.
- **C40 fixed (#66)**: server-side tour-refund recompute landed — refund is now computed from `totalCost`/`plannedCities`/`remainingCities` server-side, client-supplied `refundAmount` is ignored.

**Post-merge additions (later same day):**
- **#67**: deleted ~2000 lines of dead client components.
- **#68**: projects create hardening (B1-B4) — server-side cost recompute, field whitelist, ownership check, atomic transaction; closed the `totalCost: $1` exploit.
- **#69**: ownership sweep across every remaining game-scoped router (gameLoop, games, executives, arOffice, analytics, tour, devTools) — all game-scoped routes now enforce ownership via the shared `requireGameOwner` middleware; `execId` validation added; `PATCH /api/game/:id` now field-whitelisted.
- Phase 1 plan doc moved to `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] phase-1-server-routes-refactor-plan.md`.

**Decisions made:**
- Orchestration: parallel subagents — read-only scouts for each research review plus one mutating agent per checkout/worktree — feeding a single orchestrator that reviews before merge, same as the day-session pattern.
- Every behavior-touching PR (16, 17, 18) gets a characterization test committed green against the OLD code first, matching the PR-15 precedent.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Manual authenticated smoke pass still owed**: new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore.
- **Recording review remaining items**: B5-B7 + E-items (engine RNG determinism, no-op recorded pass, silent creation-failure UX).
- **Phase 2 (engine seams) planning can start.**

## 📅 Session Log — July 2, 2026 (Phase 1 executed: PRs 2–15, orchestrator + Opus subagent factory)

**Phase 1's entire pure-move sequence is DONE and merged, plus the first service extraction.** Ran as an orchestrator/subagent pipeline: one Opus agent per PR (Sonnet for the CI tweak), each reviewed by the orchestrator before merge. `server/routes.ts`: **5,341 → 121 lines**.

**Done this session:**
- **PRs 2–14 (pure moves) all merged** — one feature router per PR, every one verified with byte-identical route-manifest snapshot, clean `tsc`, and full vitest suite: **#42** bugReports · **#43** admin · **#44** emails (+ email zod schemas) · **#45** devTools (streaming-decay moved verbatim; TODO flags on 2 weak-auth endpoints) · **#46** content (3 public no-auth preserved) · **#47** arOffice (280-line artists handler, character-identical diff check) · **#48** executives/roles (2 legacy no-auth dialogue) · **#50** artists (fat sign-artist verbatim; `clamp` moved with dialogue handler) · **#51** projects (tour-cancel with `TODO(C40)`) · **#52** charts + tour · **#53** releases (13 endpoints, ~900 lines, relative registration order explicitly verified) · **#54** games (pickTier duplication intentionally preserved) · **#55** saves + gameLoop (`validateSnapshotCollections` → module scope in saves.ts; orphaned `select-actions` moved with phase-2 delete TODO). PRs 2–4 were stacked while merge permission was sorted; 5+ went sequentially from main.
- **routes.ts final shape**: imports + `registerRoutes()` (webhook/health/me + 17 router mounts in original registration order) + `createServer`; signature unchanged. Boot smoke on decomposed main: dev server clean, `GET /api/health` 200.
- **PR-15 gameCreationService** (**#57**, first logic change, characterization-first): new `tests/endpoints/game-creation.characterization.test.ts` (supertest, 10 tests, committed green against OLD code first, green after swap); `server/services/gameCreationService.ts` (AnalyticsService convention); POST `/api/game` handler now validate→service→respond; `pickTier` dedup verified logic-identical then removed from `GET /api/game-state` via `deriveInitialAccessTiers`; dead `defaultRoles` dropped with TODO. Suite now **555 tests**. Adds `supertest` devDep + `typeof window` guard in `tests/setup.ts` (node-env tests). vitest CI job **passed**; **auto-merge armed** pending the slow Playwright job.
- **Milestone docs PR merged** (**#56**): execution-status checklist added to the Phase 1 plan doc; `system-architecture.md` + `backend-architecture.md` now describe the feature-router layout; `ai_instructions.md` routes references fixed (file still stale overall).
- **CI: Playwright browser caching** (**#58**, Sonnet agent): `actions/cache@v4` on `~/.cache/ms-playwright` keyed on resolved `@playwright/test` version; install-deps-only on hit. First post-merge run seeds the cache; ~1–3 min savings thereafter.
- **Landed parallel-session docs** (**#49**): backlog **C40** (tour cancel trusts client `refundAmount` — fix as standalone PR now that the projects-router move is merged) + **C41** (missing `venueCapacity` bricks week advance) + `[FUTURE] tour-experience-improvement-plan.md`.

**Decisions made:**
- Full-path router convention (routers register complete paths, mounted bare at original positions, per-route auth) held for all 16 routers; import removals were grep-audited case by case.
- Merge flow: user granted `gh pr merge` permission mid-session; pure moves merged green-local per policy, PR-15 waits for CI (auto-merge armed).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **PR-15 (#57)**: confirm auto-merge completed (vitest passed; was waiting on Playwright). Then **PR-16 saveService → PR-17 releasePlanningService → PR-18 artistService**, each characterization-first, wait-for-CI. PR-16 gates on nothing (PR-14 merged).
- **Manual smoke still owed** for domains with zero HTTP coverage (plan §4 notes): authenticated pass — new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore. Deferred throughout; do once before or right after PR-16.
- **C40 fix** (server-side refund recompute) is unblocked now — standalone PR, small.
- After PR-18: move the Phase 1 plan doc to COMPLETED, final docs sweep, then Phase 2 (engine seams) planning.
- Local env: dev server and Docker test DB (`music-label-test-db`) were **stopped** at session end. Restart with `npm run test:db:start` before running tests.

## 📅 Session Log — July 1, 2026 (Session 3 — UI overflow/layout fixes)

**Interactive UI-polish session driven from the live preview.** Played the app at non-wide window sizes, found five overflow/layout bugs, fixed and pixel-verified each in the browser, merged same-day. → **PR #40** (merged to `main`, `5023ae8`).

**Done this session:**
- **SaveGameModal scroll** — with many saves the Save & Load dialog grew past the viewport. Now capped at `max-h-[85vh]`; the saves list is the only scrollable region, with the save-name input and Export/Import/Cancel footer pinned (`client/src/components/SaveGameModal.tsx`).
- **Avatar bleed-through cropped** — on the A&R Office and Artist pages, the absolutely-positioned character avatars overlapped the translucent cards below and showed through. Fix pattern: give the avatar wrapper a height equal to its negative-top offset + `overflow-hidden`, so the image crops exactly at the card's top edge (A&R: `-top-72`/`h-72`; Artist: `-top-40` + 40px tab bar + 24px gap → `h-56`). ⚠️ **The clip height mirrors the `-top-*` offset — if you reposition an avatar, change both together.**
- **MetricsDashboard responsive fix** — the desktop 3/5/3 11-column grid started at `lg` (1024px), leaving ~60px cells that money strings overflowed and pushed past the viewport (clipping Access Tiers). Sections now stack below `xl` with `min-w-0`. Money display unified via `formatMoney`/`formatSignedMoney` helpers: whole dollars, sign before the symbol (`-$16,687`, not `$-16,687.5`) across desktop/tablet/mobile layouts.
- **MusicCalendar containment** — the events panel next to the fixed-width calendar couldn't shrink (flex `min-width:auto`), so event titles/week header spilled outside the card. Added `min-w-0` + word wrap; the panel now wraps below the calendar when the card is narrow (`basis-44`).
- **GameLayout root-cause fix** — `SidebarInset`'s flex chain lacked `min-w-0`, so any wide table's intrinsic width stretched the whole page horizontally instead of scrolling inside its `overflow-auto` wrapper (traced to a dashboard table with ~766px min-content). Fixed at the layout level in `client/src/layouts/GameLayout.tsx`, which covers **every** page.
- **Verified**: each fix measured live in the browser preview (pixel-exact crop assertions, zero horizontal overflow at 1100px and 1440px); `tsc` green. Merged without waiting for CI per user call (UI-only changes).
- **Tooling**: added machine-local `.claude/launch.json` (dev-server launch config for the preview tooling) — intentionally **not committed**.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Phase 1 PR-2..12 still queued** (server routes decomposition) — unchanged from Session 2; start with bugReports → admin → emails.
- The avatar crop pattern is per-page manual math; if more pages get overlay avatars, consider extracting a small `CroppedAvatar` component so offset and clip height can't drift apart.
- Vitest suite was **not** run this session (UI-only changes, no Docker test DB started); run it as usual before the next non-trivial change.

## 📅 Session Log — July 1, 2026 (Session 2 — architecture docs, scaling decision, Phase 0 + Phase 1 kickoff)

**The big one: decided NOT to rewrite on a game engine, and started a 4-phase scaling arc instead.** Session went: stale-docs cleanup → "should I start over with a game engine?" conversation → diagnosis (the pain is monolith debt, not the web platform) → four-phase plan → Phase 0 executed and Phase 1 begun, all merged to `main` (PRs **#36–#39**).

**Done this session:**
- **Rewrote the two stale architecture docs** — `docs/02-architecture/system-architecture.md` + `database-design.md` were pre-weekly-conversion (advanceMonth, Passport auth, fictional endpoints, `monthly_actions`). Rewrote both against current code, then **verified every claim with two code-reading subagents** (26 claims checked, 5 doc fixes applied). Committed direct to `main` (`78ff2e3`). Found in passing: `executives` seeding uses role `'head_ar'` while the schema.ts comment says `'head_of_ar'`; migration `0020` lacks the temperament CHECK (Drizzle-schema-only); `progression.json`'s `difficulty_modifiers` were dead config.
- **Backlog C39 added → resolved same day** (**PR #36**): added the missing `db:generate`/`db:studio`/`db:introspect` npm scripts (drizzle-kit 0.30.4 supports all three; CLAUDE.md + database-practices.md documented them but they never existed), fixed CLAUDE.md's `npm test` description (single run, not watch), replaced POSIX `pkill` with `npx kill-port 5000`, fixed the emergency-recovery path (`migrations/`, not `drizzle/migrations/`). Backlog: **39 items, 37 done, 2 pending** (C26 ArtistPage refactor, C32 email-snapshot cap).
- **Wired the dead difficulty multiplier** (**PR #37**): `getStartingValues(difficulty)` now applies `difficulty_modifiers.starting_money_multiplier` (easy 1.5×/normal 1.0×/hard 0.7×) via new pure helpers in `shared/utils/startingValues.ts`; `POST /api/game` accepts optional `difficulty` (default `'normal'` → zero behavior change) and persists it in `flags.difficulty`. **MISSING: no UI exposes difficulty yet** — every game still starts at $500k. 9 new unit tests.
- **Scaling decision**: player asked whether to rebuild on a game engine (Unity/Godot). Answer: **no** — management sims are menu-driven by genre (Football Manager, Game Dev Tycoon, Melvor Idle are web/UI tech); `shared/engine/GameEngine` IS the engine; the pain is monolith debt. Adopted a **4-phase arc**: Phase 0 CI safety net → Phase 1 server seams → Phase 2 engine seams → Phase 3 client state ownership → Phase 4 game feel (parallel juice track, esp. the week-advance moment).
- **Phase 0 DONE** (**PR #38**, executed by an Opus subagent): vitest suite now runs in CI as a `vitest` job in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` (`postgres:16` service on 5433 + `drizzle-kit push --force` + `npm run test:run`, ~2min). Added `tests/features/game-spine-advance-save-restore.test.ts` — the create→advance 3 weeks→save→restore→parity spine was previously uncovered end-to-end. CLAUDE.md CI note updated.
- **Phase 1 plan created** (Plan subagent, code-verified): `docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/[READY] phase-1-server-routes-refactor-plan.md` — an **18-PR strangler sequence** decomposing `server/routes.ts` (5,341 lines, 85 routes) into feature routers + services. Key findings: only ONE closure-shared helper exists (the feared extraction phase collapses); the suite had **zero HTTP-layer tests** (nothing failed if a route move dropped auth middleware); `routes/analytics.ts` + `AnalyticsService.ts` already model the target convention.
- **Phase 1 PR-1 DONE** (**PR #39**): route-manifest characterization test — walks the Express router stack after `registerRoutes()` and snapshot-locks all **84 routes with middleware chains** (70× `requireClerkUser`, 10× `requireAdmin`), plus hard assertions on `/api/admin/*` and the game-mutating core loop. Every subsequent move PR now gets wiring-regression checks from CI.
- **Validated & merged**: `tsc` green; suite **545/545 (38 files, ~26s)**; PRs #36→#39 all merged to `main` (merge order #38→#36→#37 per plan gating).

**Decisions made:**
- **Merge policy for Phase 1**: pure-move PRs (2–12) merge on green-local without blocking on CI (test-only/move changes, cheap to revert); **service-extraction PRs (15–18) wait for CI** — they change production logic.
- **GitGuardian** flags the `postgres:postgres@localhost:5433` test-DB string on every PR that adds it — **confirmed false positive** (same string has been on `main` in 3 files all along), non-blocking (`MERGEABLE`). → **Action for Nes: dismiss the incident in the GitGuardian dashboard** so it stops re-flagging Phase 1 test files.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Phase 1 PR-2..12 are ready to execute** — pure one-domain-per-PR moves, order-independent; plan says start with the self-contained low-risk domains (bugReports → admin → emails). PR-13 (games router) and PR-15 (gameCreationService) were gated on #37, which is now merged. Full sequence + route inventory in the `[READY]` plan doc.
- **Difficulty UI** is an open product decision — the multiplier plumbing exists (easy/normal/hard), but nothing exposes it; the other three modifiers (`reputation_decay`, `market_variance`, `goal_time_extension`) remain unimplemented.
- **`ai_instructions.md` is badly stale** (Aug 2025, Neon/Replit era, wrong commands) — lightly patched this session; full reconciliation flagged as a spawn-task chip.
- **Phase 4 (game feel)** has no concrete tickets yet — first candidate: staged WeekSummary reveal with animated count-ups (Motion.dev already in stack).
- **Local env**: Docker test DB (`music-label-test-db`, port 5433) was used this session; a background watcher stops it after PR #39's CI finishes.

## 📅 Session Log — June 30, 2026 (Session 2 — PR #29: email-snapshot / save-load)

**Recovered, finished, reviewed, and hardened the orphaned Oct 2025 save/load work.** A large block of uncommitted email-snapshot / save-load / reputation work was sitting on this machine, never committed. Recovered it onto a branch and took it through merge-up-to-date → validation → manual smoke test → high-effort code review → fixes. → branch `feature/email-snapshot-save-load`, **PR #29** (open, ready for review/merge).

**Done this session:**
- **Synced `main`** — merged **PR #27** (focus-slot unlock reconciliation) and **PR #28** (untrack `.claude/settings.local.json`, gitignore it). Local `main` fast-forwarded to current. (The morning session's PRs #24/#25/#26 are also all merged now.)
- **Recovered the Oct 2025 work** onto `feature/email-snapshot-save-load` instead of discarding it: email snapshot capture + truncation safety, save-snapshot completeness (releaseSongs/executives/moodEvents/musicLabel/emails), label-based autosave naming, and reputation-change visibility in WeekSummary.
- **Brought the branch up to date with main** (it was cut from old main, 11 commits behind). Merge resolved 3 conflicts: `game-engine.ts` auto-merged cleanly (both reputation + focus-slot changes survived, verified), `technical-debt-backlog.md`, and took main's deletion of `settings.local.json`.
- **Reconciled docs with the branch code** — fixed stale `save-load-system-workflow.md` (snapshot **v2**, label-based autosave naming + read-time migration, keep-**3** autosave retention), marked the removed "Strategic Efficiency" achievement in the two analysis docs, added `REPUTATION_GAIN_ANALYSIS_2025-10-19.md`.
- **Validated**: `npm run check` green; **full vitest suite 532/532**. Required standing up the Docker test DB on **port 5433** (`music-label-test` container, db `music_label_test`) + manually adding the `artists_mood_check` CHECK constraint (`drizzle-kit push` doesn't materialize raw-SQL checks — logged as Comment 33). **Note: the vitest suite is NOT in CI — CI runs Playwright only — so it must be run locally.**
- **Manual smoke test** (drove the app, watched server logs): save→reload→restore ✅, export/import (fork + overwrite + malformed) ✅, autosave naming ✅, reputation display ⚠️ (gap → Comment 34). Found & fixed a legacy-autosave migration bug mid-test.
- **High-effort code review** (8 finder angles + verification) found **6 confirmed correctness bugs — all fixed** on the branch:
  1. autosave migration read `musicLabelName` from the wrong JSON path (`->'gameState'->'musicLabel'`; it's a top-level sibling) → migration was dead on real data; 2. autosave label fallback called a non-existent `GET /api/game/:id/label` (only POST exists); 3. week-advance email invalidation used `['emails']` which never matched the `emails:list`/`emails:unread-count` scopes (new emails lagged 30s); 4. misleading `+{amount}` badge on campaign completion; 5. import failed on single-wrapped snapshot files; 6. false `truncated` flag + redundant empty-page fetches.
- **Removed** a stray committed merge artifact `shared/engine/game-engine.ts.orig`.
- **Backlog grew** (`technical-debt-backlog.md`, now 38 items, 27 done / 11 pending): added Comments **33** (test-DB CHECK constraints), **34** (reputation visible only from press coverage), **35** (snapshot object built in two places — already diverged on `emailMetadata.truncated`), **36** (autosave-name format in 3 places), **37 ✅ done** (emailSnapshot dead/overlapping checks — resolved with fix #6), **38** (import double-validation vs Zod).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **PR #29 is ready for review/merge** — branch is up to date with main, `tsc` green, 532/532 tests, all 6 review bugs fixed. After merging, **resync local `main`**.
- **Remaining new backlog**: Comments **33, 34, 35, 36, 38** are deferred (cleanup + product calls), not blockers. Comment 34 (reputation visibility from non-press sources) is a product/UX decision.
- **Test infra**: a future fix for Comment 33 should provision the test DB via migrations (so CHECK constraints exist) rather than bare `drizzle-kit push`; consider whether to add the vitest suite to CI.
- **Local environment left running**: the dev server and the `music-label-test` Docker container (port 5433) were started this session — stop them if not needed.

## 📅 Session Log — June 30, 2026 (Session 1 — re-orientation & docs)

**First session back after ~8 months away.** Focus was re-orientation, repo hygiene, and documentation accuracy. No gameplay/feature changes.

**Done this session:**
- **Synced local `main`** — it was 2 PRs behind `origin/main`; fast-forwarded 8 commits to `27f4d3d` (also pruned two malformed `ux-prototypes` files).
- **Fixed a TypeScript build break** — `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` default `queryFn` was typed over a too-narrow `QueryKeyWithUrl`, unassignable to TanStack's `QueryKey` slot (TS2322). Retyped over `QueryKey`; runtime URL contract still enforced by `extractUrlFromQueryKey`. `npm run check` now passes. → branch `fix/queryclient-querykey-type`, **PR #24**.
- **Reviewed all of `docs/`** (6-agent fan-out). Headline: well-organized but two-tier currency; two core flow docs still described the obsolete monthly loop.
- **Converted the two stale flow docs to the weekly (52-week) system** — `docs/03-workflows/game-system-workflows.md` + `user-interaction-flows.md`, with code-verified corrections (decay is ~15%/week not /month; weekly burn $3–6k base + ~$1,200/artist/wk; song gen Single 2/wk, EP 3/wk; starting money $500k; campaign ends week 52). → branch `docs/weekly-workflow-conversion`.
- **Fixed the `/session-end` command** (was broken: hardcoded Linux paths, frozen dates, missing files) and added this session-log convention. → branch `chore/session-workflow`.
- **Reconciled the focus-slot unlock discrepancy (quick win #1)** — collapsed the 3 conflicting values to one source of truth. Canonical = `data/balance/progression.json → progression_thresholds.fourth_focus_slot_reputation`, set to **50** (preserves the previously shipped behavior). The engine now **reads** the threshold + base + max from config instead of hardcoding (`shared/engine/game-engine.ts:349`). Deleted the misnamed week-26 `focus_slots_unlock_threshold` from `projects.json` and its loaders/type (`data/balance.ts`, `shared/utils/dataLoader.ts`, `shared/types/gameTypes.ts`, `scripts/archive/compile-balance.ts`); set the rep value to 50 in `world.json` + the `gameData.ts` sync fallback; fixed `database-design.md` (`focus_slots DEFAULT 2 → 3`). `npm run check` passes. → branch TBD.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **(Resolved July 1, 2026) UI focus-slot cap** — Investigated end-to-end (backlog C29): the live focus-slot UI (`ExecutiveSuitePage` → `ExecutiveMeetings`/`SelectionSummary`, gated by `gameStore.selectAction()`) already honors the dynamic `gameState.focusSlots`, so the 4th slot works today — **no live bug**. Cleanup done: deleted the dead `ActionSelectionPool.tsx` + `MonthPlanner.tsx` (zero render sites) and removed a latent `.max(3)` cap on the orphaned `/api/select-actions` route (`shared/api/contracts.ts`).
- **(Historical only)** the Sept-2025 refactoring log below still says "Focus Slots: Unlock at week 26"; left as-is as a point-in-time record, but it does not reflect current behavior (reputation ≥ 50).
- **Open PRs/branches to merge or close**: PR #24 (queryClient), plus local branches `docs/weekly-workflow-conversion` and `chore/session-workflow` (not yet pushed).
- **Two open tech-debt items** (both 🔵 Low) per `docs/09-troubleshooting/technical-debt-backlog.md`: Comment 26 (`ArtistPage.tsx` is monolithic — larger refactor) and Comment 32 (email snapshot ~10k truncation cap — future enhancement). All Critical/High/Medium items are now resolved.
- **Docs still on the legacy monthly framing** in spots; index files (`docs/README.md`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`) don't list `98-research/` or `api-specifications/`.

## 🗂️ Backlog / Candidate Work
*Compiled June 30, 2026 from the docs review + onboarding. Pick from here next session.*

**Quick wins**
- [ ] **Tech-debt Comment 25** — `ClerkProvider` appearance cast to `any` in `client/src/main.tsx`; tighten typing. Small/isolated. (See `docs/09-troubleshooting/technical-debt-backlog.md`.)
- [ ] **Patch doc index files** — `docs/README.md` + `docs/CLAUDE.md` don't list `98-research/` or `api-specifications/` (invisible to navigation).
- [x] **Reconcile focus-slot unlock values** — ✅ Done June 30, 2026. Canonical source = `progression.json → fourth_focus_slot_reputation` (set to 50); engine reads threshold/base/max from config; deleted the dead week-26 `focus_slots_unlock_threshold`. See session log above.

**Medium**
- [ ] **Verify the financial bug** — `docs/98-research/FINANCIAL_CALCULATION_BUG_ANALYSIS.md` documents a dual-path revenue/expense bug; confirm whether it was fixed in current code.
- [ ] **Tech-debt Comment 26** — `client/src/pages/ArtistPage.tsx` is monolithic; split into memoized subcomponents. Larger refactor.
- [ ] **Add a GameEngine architecture doc** — `02-architecture/` has no dedicated doc for the core shared `GameEngine`, despite its centrality.

**Feature threads** (from `docs/01-planning/`)
- [ ] **Artist-mood plan** — paused after Phase 5 (Oct 12, 2025), resumable. (`implementation-specs/[IN-PROGRESS] artist-mood-plan.md`)
- [ ] **Artist-contract-system refactor** — flagged as next target; dependency map exists (`implementation-specs/artist-contract-system-dependencies.md`).

**Housekeeping**
- [ ] Merge open PRs **#24** (queryClient fix), **#25** (weekly-workflow docs), **#26** (session workflow), then resync local `main`.

- **Strategic Depth**: Quarterly release planning with seasonal multipliers
- **True Weekly Charts**: Charts update weekly like real music industry
- **Enhanced Gameplay**: More frequent decision points and faster feedback loops

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation Approach**
1. **Strategic Bulk Refactoring**: Used Cursor's search/replace for 1,600+ systematic changes
2. **Incremental Commits**: Each phase committed separately for easy rollback
3. **Database Migration**: Used Drizzle Kit for safe column renames
4. **DRY Refactoring**: Consolidated all seasonal logic into shared utilities
5. **Component Extraction**: Created reusable WeekPicker for future features

### **September 2025 - Song Quality System Enhancements**
- ✅ **Budget Impact Dampening System** - Reduced budget's dominance over quality calculations
  - ✅ Implemented configurable dampening factor (0.7) in quality.json
  - ✅ Reduces budget's impact on quality by 30% while maintaining strategic importance
  - ✅ Formula: `efficiencyRatio = 1 + 0.7 × (rawRatio - 1)` keeps ratio=1 neutral
  - ✅ Budget multiplier now ranges from 0.65x to ~1.35x (was 0.65x to 1.5x+)
  - ✅ Updated FinancialSystem.ts with dampening in both calculateBudgetQualityMultiplier and getBudgetEfficiencyRating
  - ✅ Synchronized ProjectCreationModal.tsx to apply same dampening in UI preview
  - ✅ Updated QualityTester.tsx testing interface with dampened calculations
- ✅ **Enhanced Variance System with Outliers** - More dramatic and exciting quality outcomes
  - ✅ Increased base variance ranges: Low skill ±35% (was ±20%), High skill ±10% (was ±5%)
  - ✅ Formula updated: `baseVarianceRange = 35 - (30 × combinedSkill/100)`
  - ✅ Added 10% chance for outlier events:
    - 5% Breakout Hit: 1.5x-2.0x multiplier (bigger boost for lower skill)
    - 5% Critical Failure: 0.5x-0.7x multiplier (high skill has protection)
  - ✅ 90% of songs use normal skill-based variance for consistency
  - ✅ Creates high-risk/high-reward dynamics for amateur artists

### **September 5, 2025 - Budget Quality Calculation System Overhaul**
- ✅ **Fixed Piecewise Function Calculation Errors** - Corrected budget factor multiplier calculations
  - ✅ Fixed incorrect segment calculations that were causing cumulative errors (was 1.34, now correctly 1.14)
  - ✅ Replaced additive slope calculations with explicit start/end multiplier values for each segment
  - ✅ All 6 segments now properly interpolate: penalty (0.65), below standard (0.65-0.85), efficient (0.85-1.05), premium (1.05-1.20), luxury (1.20-1.35), diminishing (1.35+)
- ✅ **Removed Double-Counting of Producer/Time Multipliers** - Fixed economic calibration issue
  - ✅ Producer and time multipliers now only apply to project cost (what player pays)
  - ✅ Removed these multipliers from minimum viable cost calculation (quality baseline)
  - ✅ Added 1.5x baseline quality multiplier for recording sessions to properly calibrate system
  - ✅ Result: Minimum budget with cheapest options now gives appropriate -17% quality penalty instead of +14% bonus
- ✅ **Frontend-Backend Synchronization** - Complete consistency across the stack
  - ✅ Updated `ProjectCreationModal.tsx` to match backend's corrected piecewise function
  - ✅ Frontend `calculateDynamicMinimumViableCost()` now identical to backend implementation
  - ✅ Both use same formula: Base × Economies × 1.5 (no producer/time multipliers)
  - ✅ Verified with comprehensive test suite showing identical calculations
- ✅ **Skill-Based Quality Variance System** - More realistic randomization
  - ✅ Implemented dynamic variance based on combined artist talent and producer skill
  - ✅ Low skill (35 avg): ±13.7% variance - high risk/reward, potential breakout hits or failures
  - ✅ Mid skill (58 avg): ±9.7% variance - moderately consistent quality
  - ✅ High skill (78 avg): ±6% variance - very reliable professional output
  - ✅ Elite skill (95 avg): ±2.9% variance - extremely consistent, "they don't miss"
  - ✅ Formula: Variance = 20% - (18% × CombinedSkill/100), applied per song individually
- ✅ **Economic Balance Improvements**
  - ✅ Minimum selectable budget now appropriately penalizes quality (as intended)
  - ✅ Higher budgets provide meaningful quality bonuses without being excessive
  - ✅ Strategic trade-offs between budget, producer quality, and time investment
  - ✅ No more gaming the system with minimum budget for quality bonuses
- ✅ **Technical Implementation Details**
  - ✅ Maintained separation of concerns: project costs include multipliers, quality baseline doesn't
  - ✅ Each song in multi-song projects gets individual random variance (realistic album variation)
  - ✅ All changes backward compatible with existing save games
