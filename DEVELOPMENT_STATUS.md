## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Interactivity Gap Analysis: adversarially-verified case file on hollow simulation; read-only, docs-only)

**A dedicated hunting session produced `docs/98-research/INTERACTIVITY_GAP_ANALYSIS_2026-07-03.md`** — an evidence-backed, ranked case file on (Track 1) features designed in docs but never wired, and (Track 2) code that runs but doesn't matter to the player. Ran as orchestrator + 6 scout subagents (2 doc-sweeps, 4 engine traces) + 3 adversarial verifiers that attempted to REFUTE every "it's dead" claim before it entered the report (the star_power_amplification false-kill precedent drove this design — and the verifiers DID catch several stale doc claims in the other direction). Every claim is backed by file:line inspected this session; two items are explicitly marked UNVERIFIED rather than asserted.

**Headline findings (consequence-weighted ranking, full detail + effort sizing + constraint collisions in the report):**
1. **Random side events are a phantom system** — 20% weekly roll (`game-engine.ts:966-980`) picks fully-authored multi-choice events from `data/events.json`, then discards everything: effects never applied, choices never presented, title never rendered.
2. **71 of 77 executive-meeting effect keys are silent no-ops** — `ActionProcessor.applyEffects` handles 6 keys with no default case, while BOTH badge renderers (DialogueInterface, SelectionSummary) promise every key to the player. Produces fake choices, free-money traps (e.g. apple_exclusive strictly dominates), and 7 all-payoff-dead meetings. S-size mitigation available (badge whitelist) independent of the L-size real wiring.
3. **`WeekSummary.tsx` `categorizeChanges` has an unrendered `other` bucket** swallowing 8 change types — including `breakthrough`, which `changeImportance.ts` classifies as HERO. One S-size UI fix un-hides several systems.
4. **The awareness economy is fully live and completely invisible** — up to 2× weekly streams (`FinancialSystem.ts:983-1013`, enabled), zero player UI (admin StreamingDecayTester only). **Backlog C42 was factually wrong** and now carries a correction note; C43 was half-wrong (DELETE-release endpoint exists server-side with safe refund; only the UI button is missing).
5. **Artist energy is display-only** (read by nothing), dialogue scene mood/energy targeting is unread (scenes picked at random), exec Level is hardcoded 1 forever, exec mood/loyalty gate nothing, charts feed nothing back (hit_single/number_one rep bonuses are dead config), reputation never decays, difficulty system has no UI and ¾ dead modifiers, achievements score on 3 of 5 axes with a mid-tier-only "Media Mogul" equality bug.

**Also produced:** a "not worth it" section (roles table = delete-not-wire; artist loyalty = deliberately refactored away; two superseded planning docs to archive), a corrected-stale-claims ledger (C40/C42/C43/C44/C45 + several planning-doc claims), and a per-finding constraint cheat-sheet (golden master / SNAPSHOT_VERSION / atomic-week / seeded-RNG collisions).

**Tech debt logged (C60–C65):** delayed artist_energy/popularity effects hit the whole roster ignoring artistId (medium); tier downgrades announce "Upgraded"; AchievementsEngine hardcoded-zero components + equality bug + 12-week copy rot (medium); dead artist columns (massAppeal/stress/creativity/moodHistory/lastMoodEvent/moodTrend) + phantom `artist.loyalty` client fallbacks; side-event roll uses unseeded Math.random; release press path writes reputation uncapped. Backlog header counts updated; C42/C43 stale-premise correction note added.

**Decisions made (Nes):** ranking lens = consequence-weighted; full Track 2 sweep; deliverable = files only (committed at session wrap, no fixes applied — read-only mission honored).

**Coordination note:** the parallel Phase 4 session merged #113–#118 mid-flight; the report's Phase-4 and modal-race bullets were reconciled against that before commit (notable-chime now wired; `warning` deliberately unwired; auto-open reworked — re-verify the stacked-modal race before scoping the XState orchestrator).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Nes: pick from the report's ranked list.** The zero-engine-risk first wave is findings 3 (render the `other`/hero bucket), 4 (awareness surfacing), 9 (difficulty picker), 11 (cancel-release button), 14 (email CTAs), plus the meeting-badge whitelist from finding 2.
- **C60 and C62 are S-size real bugs** worth folding into any nearby PR.
- Two UNVERIFIED items if anyone wants closure: legacy no-releaseId song path reachability; whether "Industry Legend" (200 rep) is strictly impossible.
- The report's corrected-stale-claims ledger should be applied to the source planning docs (C42/C43 backlog notes already annotated).

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Phase 4 COMPLETE: game feel — planned, executed, live-verified in one session; PRs #100, #102, #109, #112–#117)

**Phase 4 (game feel) went from "no tickets" to fully planned, built, merged, and live-verified**, running as orchestrator + one subagent per PR (Opus for high-risk/engine-adjacent, Sonnet for scoped builds), concurrent worktrees, orchestrator diff-review before every merge, self-merge-on-green-CI per session grant. Ran in parallel with (and coordinated live against) the Phase 3.5 + D6 session below — Phase 4's WeekSummary/GameHeader PRs were explicitly gated on 3.5 landing and started the hour the gate opened.

**Plan**: `implementation-specs/COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] phase-4-game-feel-plan.md` — 7 PRs anchored on the week-advance moment, from a two-explorer recon (UX flow map + game-feel toolkit inventory). Scope decisions from Nes: full pass, sound IN, server-side `importance` field OK.

**Shipped (all merged to `main`, CI green incl. the 3.5 grep-gate):**
- **PR-1 #100** — `AnimatedNumber` motion primitive (static on first mount by design; animates on value change) + MetricsDashboard adoption.
- **PR-2 #102** — `shared/utils/changeImportance.ts`: deterministic hero/notable/routine classifier, exhaustive over all 19 `GameChange` types (`assertNever` compile guard); optional additive `importance` on `GameChange`/`ChartUpdate`; ONE engine call site at WeekSummary assembly. Golden-master diff independently audited: 67 added lines, all `importance`, zero deletions (26/12/29 hero/notable/routine); run-twice stable.
- **#109** — six ElevenLabs stings (user-generated in their account via browser automation, user-auditioned favorites, downloaded + renamed) in `client/public/audio/` with `CREDITS.md` provenance (prompts + license basis).
- **PR-6 #112** — sound foundation: `client/src/lib/audio.ts` (plain HTMLAudioElement, autoplay-safe unlock-on-gesture, never-throws, persisted mute/volume default ON at 0.4), dock More-menu Switch+Slider control, store-level wiring with priority pick (campaign-end > hero-fanfare > tier-unlock > week-advance — one sting per week, no pile-up).
- **PR-3 #113** — **the centerpiece**: staged WeekSummary reveal (entrance → net-income count-up → revenue → "Milestone Moments" hero card with tier unlocks MOVED INTO the modal + No. 1s → notable → routine; 1.8s total, click-anywhere skip, reduced-motion instant). `useStagedReveal` timeline hook (deliberately not XState). `unlockToasts.tsx` deleted (grep-verified single caller; modal hero placement supersedes). **Review caught two animation-defeating bugs pre-merge**: (1) count-up never played (AnimatedNumber is static on first mount; fixed by driving 0→value post-mount) and (2) `RevealGroup` defined inside the component (new identity per render → subtree remounts → transitions snapped instead of animating; fixed by hoisting to module scope). Both invisible to jsdom — caught by diff review.
- **PR-4 #114** — anticipation beat: charged shimmer/pulse button while advancing + `WeekTransition` full-screen interstitial ("ADVANCING TO WEEK N", HoloDisc spin-up; 700ms min display so fast responses don't flash, never gates data, pointer-events none, 10s safety dismiss, reduced-motion renders nothing). Agent's own fake-timer tests caught a min-display-timer cancellation bug mid-build.
- **PR-5 #115** — celebration tier: `ParticleBurst` SVG primitive (no new dep, no RNG — hashed per-index scatter; reduced-motion baked in), No. 1 burst over the hero card, `notable-chime` wired at the notable stage (skip/instant-suppressed; `warning` left unwired — no clean trigger), CampaignResultsModal staged (score count-up, staggered cells, entry burst, click-to-skip).
- **PR-7 #116** — HoloDisc `pulse` prop (`ds-ring` halo, caller-owned duration) + CommandDock triggers: ~6s on a hero/notable week, ~1s on action selection. Fixed a pre-existing missing React import in CommandDock (first-ever direct test render).
- **#117** — **the live pass found a 10-month-old bug**: WeekSummary auto-open NEVER fired — `weeklyOutcome.week === currentWeek - 1` while the engine stamps `summary.week` = the week advanced TO and increments `currentWeek` to the same value (`game-engine.ts:156,172`) → mathematically always false, dead since the Sept 2025 month→week conversion (`8e5cdbe`), masked by the old toasts (removed in #113, which made this fix load-bearing). Fixed to `=== currentWeek`.

**Live verification (dev server + real browser, evidence screenshots in-session):** advance click → charged button → WeekTransition interstitial captured mid-flight → modal AUTO-OPENED (post-#117) → net-income count-up observed mid-spring (-$2,396) and settled (-$20,167) → Milestone Moments hero card glowing with a NEW ACCESS UNLOCKED entry → HoloDisc dock pulse visible on both triggers. Player's real save protected: preview-browser run used a manual backup ("phase4-preview-backup wk12") and was restored after; user-browser run used the existing Midnight Records test game. NOT verified by ear: the stings audible-in-practice check — Nes should confirm audio while playing. Gotcha for future preview passes: the preview tab reports `visibilityState: hidden`, so rAF-driven springs freeze — motion verification needs a real visible browser tab (claude-in-chrome), not the preview harness.

**Decisions made:** full-pass scope + sound in scope + engine `importance` field (Nes, session start); sound assets = ElevenLabs generation over CC0 packs (Nes auditioned + starred winners); default sound ON at low volume; `warning` sting deliberately unwired; taste rule enforced in review ("annoying on the 30th week" = blocking).

**Suite:** 774 → ~800+ (every PR added tests; client suite alone grew ~60 tests incl. reveal characterization, fake-timer transition tests, audio-manager unit tests, holo-disc/CommandDock pulse tests). `tsc` clean throughout.

**Post-wrap playtest round (same day, Nes at the keyboard):** Nes ran the UX checklist live and reported two issues, both fixed and merged as **#118** (`4ce8d9a`) within the hour: (1) the HoloDisc action-selection pulse was unreadably subtle and the halo looked off-center (the dock's glass panel was occluding it — it sat at `-z-10` behind ancestor backgrounds) → the disc now spins ~4x faster while pulsing (the readable signal) with a brighter transform-centered halo at `z-0`; (2) the results modal re-popped every time the player navigated back to the dashboard → the auto-open dedupe moved from Dashboard component state (resets on remount) to a one-shot `weeklyOutcomeAutoShow` store flag (set only by `advanceWeek`, consumed on first show, explicitly false on load/restore/new-game, not persisted). Both user-verified live before merge.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Nes: audio audition** — play a few weeks with sound on; tune per-sting volume/selection if anything grates (assets swap trivially in `client/public/audio/`).
- **C56** (façade selector re-render bail-out) unchanged — became relevant to animation code; PR-3/4 worked around it via local state per the sanctioned pattern.
- **C58** (advance-week idempotency guard, from the D6 handoff) — good companion for any future GameHeader work; not done this session.
- Phase 4 plan doc moved to COMPLETED; the scaling arc (Phase 0 → 4) is now **fully complete**.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Phase 3.5 + D6 COMPLETE: PRs #98–#111 minus Phase 4's, orchestrator + subagent factory)

**Phase 3.5 (gameState → TanStack Query) AND D6 (whole-week transaction atomicity) both planned and fully executed in one orchestrated session** — same pattern as Phases 1–3: planner agents first, one implementation agent per PR in isolated worktrees, adversarial reviewer on every med-high-risk PR, CI-gated self-merge (user-granted this session). All merged to `main` (final: `73cb031`). Ran concurrently with the parallel Phase 4 session (PRs #100/#102/#109 landed mid-flight; coordinated via relayed constraints, no conflicts).

**D6 — the week advance is now ONE atomic transaction (PRs #101, #105, #107):**
- **#101** — failure-injection characterization: injectable-deps tests pinning the OLD broken behavior (crash between tx1/tx2 → half-applied week; error during tx1 → escaping artist-mood write survives rollback). Found in planning: the "two-transaction split" understated it — `updateArtist` had no tx param and `updateProject` silently dropped its tx arg, so artist/project/release writes escaped BOTH transactions (autocommit).
- **#105** — threaded `dbTransaction` through 11 storage methods + ~30 call sites; Test B flipped (escapes now roll back). Adversarial review: sound; golden master byte-identical.
- **#107** — merged tx2 into tx1 (one `db.transaction` for the whole advance, statement order verbatim) + `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the game row (concurrent advances serialize; new concurrency test proves it). Test A flipped: crash at the worst-case point → TOTAL rollback (songs/emails/charts, tour stats, release flags, artist mood, week, money). Review found one MEDIUM (config JSON loads + Zod ran inside the row lock every advance) — fixed pre-merge by hoisting above the tx. Golden master 10/10 byte-identical: zero gameplay change.
- Follow-up logged, not built: reject-on-stale-week idempotency guard (**C58**).

**Phase 3.5 — the TanStack cache is the single owner of the gameState spine (PRs #98, #99, #103, #104, #106, #108, #110, #111):**
- **#98** — spine characterization net (35 pins: slot math, advanceWeek merge quirk incl. refetch-beats-response precedence, adoptServerBalances, orphan cleanup, snapshot assembly input).
- **#99** — deleted the dead `updateGameState` three-way fallback (zero call sites, independently verified; removed a latent musicLabel-clobber bug).
- **#103/#104** — `useGameState()`/`useGameState(selector)`/`useGameId()` façade + mechanical migration of ALL ~36 spine-reader files (23 components/hooks, 11 pages, 2 stragglers the plan's inventory missed). CI caught a co-located-test blind spot (`ArtistRoster.test.tsx` selector-blind store mock) — fixed; lesson institutionalized: validate with `npx vitest run tests/client client/src`, both paths.
- **#106** — `['gameState:record', gameId]` key + `commitGameState()` funnel; all 12 store write sites dual-write Zustand + `setQueryData`; cache≡store pinned after every action.
- **#108** — THE FLIP: façade reads the query cache. Implementer discovered the plan's mechanism was wrong (RQ v5 `notifyManager` batches `useQuery` notifications → breaks same-tick slot math) and used the sanctioned alternative: `useSyncExternalStore` directly on the QueryCache; same-tick property proven by RTL test. Adversarial review: ship-worthy; two non-blocking notes logged (**C56** selector bail-out, **C57** cold-fallback edge).
- **#110** — retired the Zustand copy: store keeps only a `{ id }` session pointer; `readGameState()` serves imperative reads (guards, saveGame, SaveGameModal); snapshot shape FROZEN (`SNAPSHOT_VERSION` still 2, `musicLabel` sibling verified); localStorage partialize byte-identical. Adversarial review traced save/export integrity end-to-end: clean, no circular test pins.
- **#111** — client/CLAUDE.md ownership rewrite, stale-comment sweep, **grep-gate test** (`gameState-ownership.grepgate.test.ts`) permanently enforcing the façade rule, all 10 plan acceptance criteria verified + checked off.

**Decisions made:** self-merge on green CI (session grant); D6 strictly all-or-nothing (no staged fallback); Phase 3.5 goes to full Zustand retirement (no permanent dual-write); legacy localStorage persist shape kept (no version bump); golden-master drift rule (root-cause per field or stop — result: zero unexplained drift all session).

**Tech debt logged (C55–C59, `c2052df`):** engine swallows email-creation errors (found by D6 failure injection); façade selector re-render bail-out; cold-cache fallback 404 edge; advance-week idempotency guard (medium); triage of the ~21 itemized discovered-debt findings in the two plan docs' §7.

**Verification:** baseline 776/776 before any change; every PR merged on green CI (vitest + Playwright); isolated full-suite runs during D6 hit 851–852 passing; plan docs (incl. Phase 3's, retroactively) moved to `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] …`.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Phase 4 (game feel) is UNBLOCKED and already resumed** (parallel session, `feat/phase4-pr3-staged-reveal`). Its rules: spine reads via the façade only; record writes via store actions only; validate both test paths.
- **C58** (advance-week idempotency guard) is the one medium-priority follow-up from this session.
- **C59**: triage the two plan docs' §7 discovered-debt lists (~21 items with file:line refs).
- Docker test DB (`music-label-test-db`, port 5433) left RUNNING for the Phase 4 session.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Full v2 website redesign: "Neo-Cyber HUD", 10 packages → PR #97)

**The entire client was redesigned to the Design System v2 ("neo-cyber HUD": dark indigo #070610, glass panels, chromatic hairlines, spectral neon accents, glow-based depth) imported from the user's claude.ai/design project.** Developed locally on worktree branch `claude/adoring-solomon-db2391`, then pushed as **PR #97** on user approval (merge on green CI granted). Ran as orchestrator + 9 concurrent package agents (Fable/Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) with strict disjoint file ownership in one shared worktree; every package audited against tool evidence before its commit. Post-review live-feedback rounds folded in: stat scale 26→20px, outline-button variant fix, chart row glow removal, dock rebalance + reorder, header declutter (stacked AUTO/Advance Week), true radial splash menu with grooved vinyl, and the real `liquid-chrome-bg.jpg` asset (user-supplied) committed.

**Commits (in order):** `472c640` design refs/spec/inventory docs → `e30395f` Phase 1 token foundation → `29d5754` D splash/menu → `330d397` A Command Dock shell → `281f690` E2a Plan Release → `868ad36` C artist surfaces → `c1a2d2c` G admin pass → `db81644` E2b sessions/tours/charts → `23120d7` E1 exec+A&R → `6bf39bf` F modals/emails → `5dfbe4e` B dashboard widgets → `f41f725` gradient token normalization → (this docs commit).

**What changed:**
- **Phase 1 foundation**: `tailwind.config.ts` v2 palette (`surface-*`, `neon-*`, `positive/negative/warning/money`, radii 16/13/9, glow shadows, `ds-*` keyframes; legacy `brand-*` remapped to v2 hues), `index.css` CSS vars + `.glass-panel`/`.chromatic-hairline`/`.hud-ticks`/`.backdrop-*`/`.text-aberration`/`.shimmer-bar` + reduced-motion support, fonts trimmed to Inter/JetBrains Mono/Major Mono Display, 14 shadcn primitives restyled, new `HoloDisc` + `PageBackdrop` primitives.
- **Navigation replaced**: `GameSidebar.tsx` DELETED → floating `CommandDock.tsx` (center holo-disc home, More overflow, Clerk UserButton, migrated modals + AUTO focus filler) + `GameHeader.tsx` (balance/week/Advance Week). Full feature-mapping table in the Package A agent report; one dead-code deletion (unreachable sidebar New Game flow).
- **All player surfaces restyled** (directional fidelity, zero logic changes): dashboard widgets, artist pages/tabs/cards/dialogue, exec suite + A&R, Plan Release, Recording, Live Performance, Top 100 charts, Office empty state, splash/landing/menu, all modals + 9 email templates. Admin/dev pages got a mechanical dark-theme token pass.
- **Design references archived**: `docs/04-frontend/design/v2/` (8 HTML comps + distilled `design-system-v2.md` spec + `redesign-inventory.md`). CLAUDE.md color section + client/CLAUDE.md nav section updated.

**Verification (evidence in-session):** `npm run check` clean at every package commit and at the end; **full vitest 774/774 passing** (68 files, Docker test DB); live visual smoke on the dev server — MainMenu, Dashboard, Artists, Plan Release, Executive Suite all render v2 with **zero console errors**; SaveGameModal export logic verified byte-untouched via diff-hunk audit; test-pinned strings/classes (access-tier tests, ArtistSelector `text-green-500` helpers, export toasts) preserved.

**Decisions made:**
- User pre-answers: tokens-first approach; ADOPT the Command Dock nav (replacing sidebar); directional fidelity; ALL surfaces in scope; worktree-local first, GitHub push + merge-on-green-CI granted later in session.
- `liquid-chrome-bg.jpg` could not be imported (claude.ai/design API 256KB cap; file is 425KB) — user supplied it; committed to `client/public/`, all backdrop layers pick it up automatically. Logged as **C54** (resolved same-day; appears as "C51" in earlier commit messages — renumbered when main's own C51 landed in parallel).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- New backlog items C52 (chartUtils/marketingUtils still emit v1 classes/FA strings), C53 (redesign leftovers: ChartPerformanceCard light variant, dead widget code, double `max-w` containers).
- Deferred by design: mobile/responsive polish of the dock on narrow screens was styled per mockup (desktop-first) — worth a hands-on pass on small viewports.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Phase 3 COMPLETE + backlog cleared: PRs #87–#96, C26/C49 fixed, C32/C42/C43 dispositioned, show-booking regression fixed live)

**Phase 3 (client state ownership) planned AND executed in one orchestrated session, plus the tech-debt backlog fully dispositioned.** Ran as orchestrator + subagent factory (one Opus/Sonnet agent per PR in isolated worktrees, adversarial reviewer subagent on every med-high-risk PR before merge, fresh-context verifier at the end). Merge policy this session: user-granted self-merge on green CI. Everything below is merged to `main` (final: `0885ff0` + docs commits); full suite **774/774** (was 696), `tsc` clean, CI green on `main`'s own push runs.

**Backlog work (all merged):**
- **C49 ✅** (`2b57880`) — `loadGameFromSave` now invalidates `EMAIL_LIST_SCOPE`/`EMAIL_UNREAD_SCOPE` keyed on the server-confirmed `restoredGameId` (covers overwrite + fork; both SaveGameModal call sites funnel through it). Regression-tested in the Phase 3 client net.
- **C26 ✅** (PR #89) — `ArtistPage.tsx` **1,180 → 369 lines**; five tabs + `PerformanceMetrics` extracted as `React.memo` components under `client/src/components/artist/` with the page's first-ever tests (12 render smokes). Independent review confirmed byte-identical JSX and verified every dead-code deletion against pre-refactor main. Avatar-crop block untouched.
- **C32 ⏸️ deferred with teeth** — cap quantified as unreachable (~100–500 emails per 52-week campaign vs the 10,000 cap; no per-artist/per-song weekly email loops exist — three independent scouts agreed); the dead-write `truncated` flag is now surfaced as an export toast (`8669235`). Saves-list warning would need a server change (out of scope).
- **C42/C43 ⏸️** — explicitly deferred by product decision (user call at session start); annotated in the backlog.
- **C50 🆕 logged** — `tests/client/` jsdom tests carry an incidental Docker-DB dependency via the shared `tests/setup.ts` `beforeAll`; low, not scheduled.
- Deleted the stale `_tmp-advance-week-timing.test.ts` scratch diagnostic.

**Phase 3 (PRs #87–#96, plan doc: `[READY] phase-3-client-state-ownership-plan.md`):**
- **PR-1 #87** — client characterization net (`tests/client/`): gameStore action pins, snapshot-shape pin, and a **query-key contract test** (every store invalidation must match a real hook key) with 5 red pins via `it.fails`.
- **PR-3 #88** — fixed the four dead `['*-roi']` invalidations (real keys have the scope at element 1) + removed the dead `['executives']` one; red pins flipped green. The stale guidance in `client/CLAUDE.md` that prescribed the dead keys was corrected too.
- **PR-4 #90** — the byte-identical 6-endpoint fan-out copied across `loadGame`/`loadGameFromSave`/`advanceWeek` collapsed into one `fetchGameBundle`.
- **PR-5 #92 / PR-8 #91** — `useCharts` and `useExecutives` hooks (ran in parallel; #92 rebased over #91's contract-test edits — keep-both conflicts only). Executives: machine stays injection-pure via an `ensureQueryData`-backed injected fetch; thin store copy kept as sanctioned snapshot input.
- **PR-6 #93 / PR-7 #94 / PR-9 #95** — `useReleases`+`useSongs`, `useProjects`, `useArtists`+`useDiscoveredArtists`: the store stopped owning all server collections; the fan-out seeds the query caches (`setQueryData`, zero extra requests); mutations invalidate. Projects/artists have no dedicated GET endpoints, so their queryFns select from `/api/game/:id` (client-only phase, no server changes). Reviewer on #95 caught a real regression — the A&R 404 short-circuit lost in the retry path — fixed pre-merge (`4047121`). The discovered-artists client-persistence worry was disproven: the persist partialize never included them; the server flags array is the source of truth.
- **PR-10 #96** — the drift fix the phase existed for: `signArtist`/`createProject`/`planRelease` no longer do client-side money/creativeCapital arithmetic; they adopt server balances via `adoptServerBalances` refetch (none of the three endpoints return balances — verified in server code). Pins now use server numbers that differ from what client math would compute, plus a double-fire no-compounding test.
- **PR-2 of the plan was dropped** — obsoleted by the C49 fix landing before planning finished (its test survives in PR-1).
- **Fresh-context verifier: MEETS SPEC** — all 8 §4 acceptance criteria pass with independently observed evidence; the only find was a stale header counter in the backlog doc (fixed).

**Decisions made:**
- Session grants (via AskUserQuestion at start): self-merge on green CI; plan-and-execute Phase 3 continuously; C42 + C43 deferred.
- `client/CLAUDE.md` State Management + Cache Management sections rewritten to describe the Phase 3 ownership model (the "Persisted" list had never matched the actual partialize).

**Post-wrap live smoke (same day, user at the keyboard):** started the dev server and played the game hands-on. Found a real regression — **booking a show/tour had been silently broken since PR #68** (July 2): the create-project hardening schema required `songCount > 0`, but `LivePerformancePage` has always sent `songCount: 0` for tours, so every booking 400'd with "Invalid project data". NOT a Phase 3 regression (client payload unchanged; the earlier smoke pass created a Single, never a tour, so it slipped through). Fixed server-side (`4b07e07`): `songCount` is now `nonnegative` with a refine keeping the ≥1 requirement for Single/EP; two regression tests added (the real tour payload → 200 + correct charge; Single with 0 → still 400); projects-create suite 13/13. **User confirmed booking works live.** Also found during play: the "On Tour" artist badge lags the tour's COMPLETE status by exactly one week (engine advances tour stage with `>` not `>=` on cities played; badge reads `stage === 'production'`) — logged as **C51** with root-cause file refs and two fix options, not fixed.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Deferred from Phase 3** (plan §3 footnote): full `gameState`→TanStack migration (the spine, read in ~30 files) — a "Phase 3.5" candidate; `updateGameState` three-way fallback; orphan-cleanup path.
- **Phase 4 (game feel)** still has no tickets; first candidate remains the staged WeekSummary reveal.
- **D6** whole-week transaction atomicity — still a filed idea.
- ~~Manual smoke of the Phase 3 surface~~ — **done live same day** (see post-wrap smoke above): booking, week advance, tour completion all exercised; found the pre-existing booking bug + C51.
- Backlog: 51 items — 46 completed, 3 deferred by decision (C32/C42/C43), 2 pending (C50 client-test DB coupling, C51 On-Tour badge lag; both low).

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (PR #86 merged, manual smoke pass, native-dialog UX sweep, C49)

**Picked up the previous session's unmerged remote work, ran the manual authenticated smoke pass that's been owed since Phase 1, found and fixed a real UX bug it surfaced, then swept the whole client for the same bug class.** Everything below is merged to `main` (`612bb88`), pushed directly per user instruction (no PR).

**Done this session:**
- **Found and merged PR #86** — the prior session's tour/press tech-debt sweep (C41, C44–C48) had been committed and pushed to `origin/claude/onboarding-08l2x6` but never opened as a PR or merged; `main` itself was up to date with `origin/main` so `git pull` reported nothing, which is what surfaced the gap. Verified locally (`tsc` clean, 696/696 tests passing, 0 skipped) before opening and merging **PR #86** (`themightynes/music-label-manager#86`).
- **Ran the manual authenticated smoke pass** owed since Phase 1: signed in, backed up the existing "Sonic Boom Entertainment" save, created a new game ("Midnight Records"), ran an A&R op → discovered and signed an artist, created a Single project, planned its release, advanced through week 4→6, and watched the release execute live — **145,286 plays, 8 press mentions (live proof the C45 fix works), $8,264 earned, reputation 5→22**. Also exercised save/restore: manual save → loaded an older autosave → confirmed state correctly reverted (money/reputation/access tiers) → restored forward to the newer checkpoint → survived a full reload.
- **Found a real bug during the smoke test**: the release-planning success flow used native `alert()`/`confirm()` (Windows-native popups) instead of in-app UI — this also explained why browser automation hung mid-flow (native dialogs block the page and aren't part of the DOM). Fixed `PlanReleasePage.tsx`'s two calls (success → `toast()`, "plan another?" → the existing `ConfirmDialog`), then **swept the entire `client/src` tree** for the same anti-pattern: `FocusSlotStatus.tsx` (A&R cancel-operation → `ConfirmDialog`), `ArtistDiscoveryTable.tsx` (dev-only debug dump → console.log + toast), `ActionsViewer.tsx` admin tool (discard-unsaved-changes → the file's existing `AlertDialog` save-confirmation pattern), plus two more `alert()`s in `PlanReleasePage.tsx` (song-title validation/save-failure → toast). Zero native `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` calls remain in `client/src`. `tsc` clean.
- **Logged Comment 49** (tech-debt backlog): after a save/load restore, the inbox briefly shows stale pre-restore emails until a full page reload. Traced the actual cause — `loadGameFromSave` (`gameStore.ts`) writes `emails` straight into Zustand but never invalidates the `useEmails` TanStack Query cache (`EMAIL_LIST_SCOPE`/`EMAIL_UNREAD_SCOPE`), same family as the previously-fixed week-advance email-invalidation gap. Underlying data is correct immediately; this is a display-only cache-invalidation gap. Refreshed the backlog's summary stats while in there (44 completed / 5 pending / 49 total, up from a stale 47/38/9).
- **Committed and pushed directly to `main`** (`612bb88`) per explicit user instruction — no PR for this batch (UX fix + docs).

**Decisions made:**
- User confirmed: skip the PR/review flow for this batch, commit straight to `main`.
- Smoke test used a fresh new game rather than the existing save, after backing the existing save up first — avoids risk to real progress while still exercising the full new-game → release → restore path.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Comment 49 fix itself is NOT done** — only logged. The actual fix (invalidate `EMAIL_LIST_SCOPE`/`EMAIL_UNREAD_SCOPE` after `loadGameFromSave`) is still open.
- **Backlog remaining (5)**: C49 (new, above), C42 (awareness dead bookkeeping — product decision), C43 (planned releases can't be cancelled/edited), C26 (ArtistPage refactor), C32 (email snapshot cap).
- **Phase 3 (client state ownership) planning** still queued; D6 whole-week transaction atomicity still a filed idea; difficulty UI still unexposed.
- Two untracked local scratch files remain in the working tree (`.claude/launch.json`, `tests/endpoints/_tmp-advance-week-timing.test.ts`) — left alone, not part of any commit this session.

## 📅 Session Log — July 3, 2026 (Tech-debt sweep: tour & release preview↔execution parity, C41–C48)

**Cleared every remaining Critical/High/tour-family backlog item in one session — backlog now 44/48 done (0 Critical, 0 High).** All work is on branch **`claude/onboarding-08l2x6`** (5 commits, pushed, **no PR opened yet** — that's the first next step). Remote-container session: no Docker available, so the vitest suite ran against a native PostgreSQL 16 cluster stood up on port 5433 (same `postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/music_label_test` contract as CI).

**Done this session:**
- **C46 ✅** — `POST /api/tour/estimate` now honors an explicit `venueCapacity` for `totalBudget` (via `calculateTourCostsWithCapacity`); tier-RNG draw only as no-capacity fallback. Found the ticket's "display-only" framing was wrong: `LivePerformancePage` passes `totalBudget` back as the tour's charged `totalCost`, so the random draw was leaking into what the player pays. Estimate characterization test now pins `totalBudget`/`canAfford` exactly (old `<rng-derived>` normalization gone).
- **C47 ✅ (two steps)** — first aligned the estimate route's `artistPopularity` default to the engine's `|| 50`; then per product decision changed **both** sides to floor zero/unset popularity to **1** (`artist.popularity || 1`) — a true unknown tours as a nobody, not a mid-tier act. No RNG-stream impact; golden master unaffected (fixture artist is popularity 60). Parity test: popularity-0 ≡ popularity-1 estimates, and popularity-0 revenue < popularity-50 (guards the old default from regressing).
- **C41 ✅** — a tour missing `metadata.venueCapacity` (legacy/imported save) no longer throws in `TourProcessor` and bricks week advancement; falls back to the **deterministic midpoint** of the stored tier's range (clubs → 275). New golden-master scenario `legacy-tour-week` pins it.
- **C48 ✅ (new entry, found+fixed same day)** — `TourProcessor` back-derived the marketing budget via `calculateTourCosts`' hidden random tier-capacity draw, so executed marketing spend drifted from the `budgetPerCity × cities` the player paid. Now extracted against the tour's actual capacity. Removes one RNG draw per tour → golden-master `tour-week` snapshot regenerated (fixture marketing now exactly $6,650/city; was $8,619.80 inflated by a random ~206 capacity). Only the tour scenario shifted; all others byte-identical.
- **C45 ✅** — the backlog's `star_power_amplification`-is-dead claim was **wrong**: it's live in `FinancialSystem.calculateStreamingOutcome` (every release's initial streams) with unit-test coverage — backlog corrected, config kept. The real fix: `weeklyStats.pressMentions` was hardcoded 0 (standing TODO) while MetricsDashboard displays it in 3 places; `WeekSummary.pressMentions` now accumulates pickups from release press coverage (`ReleaseProcessor`) + PR campaigns (`ActionProcessor`). Release-week golden master gained only the new `pressMentions: 8` field.
- **C44 ✅ (was the last High)** — the "two independent calculation paths" premise was **stale**: since Phase 2, `calculateSophisticatedReleaseOutcome` is a thin adapter delegating to `calculateReleasePreview` (one multiplier chain; metadata field names verified write↔read). The real residual divergence: `processPlannedReleases` fetched **the first artist in the game** (`getArtistsByGame(...)[0]`) instead of the release's artist — on multi-artist rosters, execution used the wrong artist's popularity while the preview used the right one. Fixed to `getArtist(release.artistId)`. New golden-master scenario `multi-artist-release-week` pins it (popularity-90 release artist → 232,553 streams vs 156,368 for the popularity-50 fixture); single-artist `release-week` snapshot stayed byte-identical. Accepted inherent preview/execution deltas (RNG draw position, state drift between plan and release week, lead-single split) documented in the backlog resolution.
- **Deleted the 3 skipped pre-flip characterization pins** (A&R pre-pure-read block ×2, artists-PATCH pre-hardening baseline) — their keep-visible-in-the-diff purpose expired when the Phase 2 PRs merged. Suite now **695 passed, 0 skipped**; `tsc` clean.

**Decisions made:**
- Zero/unset artist popularity floors to **1** in tour math, both estimate and engine (`|| 1`, so a genuine popularity-0 artist is no longer silently treated as 50). Sanctioned behavior change, scoped to zero/unset only.
- C41 fallback uses the tier-range **midpoint, not an RNG draw**, so legacy tours can't perturb the seeded stream for other systems.
- `TourProcessor`'s header now carries a POST-EXTRACTION CHANGES log (C47/C41/C48) since the file is no longer character-identical to the extracted original.
- `star_power_amplification` stays — it's live config; the backlog claim was corrected rather than the config deleted.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Open a PR for `claude/onboarding-08l2x6`** (5 commits: C46+C47 estimate fixes, popularity floor, C41/C48/C45 batch, C44, skipped-test cleanup) and merge; then resync `main`.
- **Manual authenticated smoke pass STILL owed** (fourth session running): new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore.
- **Backlog remaining (4)**: C42 (awareness is dead bookkeeping — product decision: wire into streaming multiplier or stop celebrating it), C43 (planned releases can't be cancelled/edited — feature + partial-refund design), C26 (ArtistPage refactor), C32 (email snapshot cap).
- **Phase 3 (client state ownership) planning** still queued; D6 whole-week transaction atomicity still a filed idea; difficulty UI still unexposed.

## 📅 Session Log — July 2, 2026 Late Evening (Phase 2 engine seams: full decomposition, PRs #72–#84)

**Phase 2 (engine seams) is DONE and merged to `main` — the entire 13-PR sequence executed in one session, same orchestrator/subagent factory pattern as Phase 1.** `shared/engine/game-engine.ts` went **5,116 → 1,136 lines**; 8 new processor modules live under `shared/engine/processors/` (~3,900 lines total). The engine is now fully deterministic and covered by a golden-master characterization harness. Suite grew **545 → 692 passing (3 skipped)**.

**Done this session:**
- **PR-1 (#72) — determinism foundation**: seeded every remaining gameplay `Math.random()` call — the song-quality outlier roll, tour attendance variance, and a `FinancialSystem` breakthrough-growth roll the original plan missed — through the seeded RNG. Deleted a dead block that was silently shifting the RNG stream. Switched A&R `discoveryTime` from a wall-clock ISO string to sim-time (`week N`) so save-restore is reproducible. Distribution-verified (outlier rates, variance bounds) before merge.
- **PR-2 (#73) — golden-master harness**: 8 seeded fixture scenarios run `advanceWeek` end-to-end; a normalizer strips UUIDs/timestamps so snapshots are byte-comparable; run-twice stability check confirms determinism. This became the safety net for every extraction PR that followed.
- **PR-3 — `advanceWeekService` extraction**: pulled the orchestration out of `gameLoop.ts` (407 → 75 lines); the two-transaction split moved verbatim (no transactionality changes — that's the filed D6 follow-up).
- **PR-4 — A&R artists GET made a pure read**: deleted an in-GET `Math.random()` write and legacy dual-format branches; `arOffice.ts` 408 → 284 lines.
- **PR-5..11 — the 8 engine processors**, each a verbatim move guarded byte-identical by the golden master, using a new `WeekContext` pattern + `GameEngine.weekContext()` helper: `AROfficeProcessor`, `ProgressionProcessor` + `WeeklyFinancesProcessor`, `TourProcessor`, `SongGenerationProcessor` (+17 quality unit tests — first-ever coverage for the quality formula), `ProjectStageProcessor` (**B6 resolved** — deleted the ~95-line no-op "recorded" pass and wired the previously-never-firing "ready for release" notification; songs are born recorded), `ReleaseProcessor` (the biggest, ~1,250 lines, split across 2 commits), and `ActionProcessor` + `ArtistStateProcessor` (the `applyEffects` coupling hub, extracted last by design).
- **PR-12 — dead code + dead config sweep**: ~440 net lines removed (`quality_bonus`/`segment_slopes` ranges/`quality_per_song_impact`/`project_durations` config keys + their types); stopped the engine writing legacy A&R singular keys (re-sourced a hidden email read along the way to stay byte-identical).
- **PR-13 (#84) — engine-boundary leftovers**: artists PATCH now `.strict()`-whitelisted (`{mood, energy}` only, `INVALID_ARTIST_FIELDS` on violation); removed the stale `defaultRoles` TODO; routed `GET /api/game-state` auto-create through the new `gameCreationService.createBareGame` (**D4** — deliberately the *bare* creation method, not full `createGame`, because `createGame` also seeds a label + executives, which would suppress `GamePage`'s label-creation modal; documented in the PR).

**The one player-visible change:** the B6 fix in PR-9 — the "recording complete, ready for release" notification now actually fires. Everything else in this phase is refactor-only; the plan's three sanctioned behavior changes (seeded-RNG per-seed differences, the B6 notification, the A&R legacy-branch response) are the only intended deltas.

**Decisions made:**
- **D1**: engine stays in `shared/` (server-only in practice, but a move to `server/engine/` is zero-behavior-gain churn; revisit in Phase 3).
- **D6**: whole-week transaction atomicity stays out of scope — the per-step tx boundaries moved verbatim; wrapping the whole week in one transaction is a filed hardening follow-up, not bundled into this phase.
- Determinism (PR-1) and the golden master (PR-2) were treated as the enabling foundation — nothing in PR-3 onward was allowed to move until both landed, since RNG-stream order is behavior and the golden master is what proves a move is verbatim.

**Honest status: everything above is merged to `main`.** No open PRs from this phase.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Manual authenticated smoke pass is STILL owed** (carried over from Phase 1, not done this session either): new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore.
- **Two tour-estimate inconsistencies found during PR-7**, both need a product/behavior decision (logged to the tech-debt backlog this session):
  1. `POST /api/tour/estimate`'s `totalBudget` draws venue-capacity from the tier RNG even when the caller supplies an explicit capacity — display-only today, but makes `canAfford` checks flaky against the actual tour outcome.
  2. `artistPopularity` defaults to `0` in the estimate route but `50` in the engine's actual tour processing — the estimate and the real tour can diverge for the same artist.
- **Whole-week transaction atomicity** (D6 follow-up) — still just a filed idea, not scheduled.
- **Phase 3 (client state ownership) planning can begin.**

## 📅 Session Log — July 2, 2026 Evening (PR-16..18 services + security hardening wave)

**Continued the Phase 1 service-extraction sequence (PR-16, PR-17, PR-18) and, in parallel, ran a security-focused wave off this morning's three `docs/98-research` reviews (RECORDING_SESSION, OWNERSHIP_AUTHORIZATION_SWEEP, AR_OFFICE).** Same orchestrator pattern as the day session: parallel scout subagents plus one mutating agent per checkout, worktree-isolated, characterization-test-first for every behavior-touching PR. **Everything below is merged to `main`** — PR-16 (#61), PR-17 (#63), PR-18 (#64), and the full security wave.

**Done this session:**
- **PR-16 saveService extraction (#61)**: `server/routes/saves.ts` **629 → 139 lines**. New `server/services/saveService.ts` (`createSave`/`restoreOverwrite`/`restoreFork`/`deleteSave`) follows the `AnalyticsService` convention. Characterization-first: `tests/endpoints/save-restore.characterization.test.ts` (11 tests, committed green against the old handler before the swap).
- **Security wave, PR #62**: deleted the two zero-auth routes found by the reviews — `GET /api/debug/game/:gameId/revenue` and `POST /api/select-actions` (the latter already flagged as orphaned/dead in a July 1 follow-up note) — and admin-gated `POST /api/dev/markets-config`.
- **PR-17 releasePlanningService extraction (#63)**: new `server/services/releasePlanningService.ts`; introduced a shared `server/middleware/requireGameOwner.ts` applied to all 12 `:gameId` releases routes; fixed a **live negative-marketing-budget money-credit exploit** in the release-plan handler; added a field whitelist on release create. `server/routes/releases.ts` **908 → 685 lines**.
- **PR-18 artistService extraction (#64, stacked on #63)**: new `server/services/artistService.ts`. `sign-artist` now derives `signingCost`/stats server-side from `data/artists.json` + the discovered pool instead of trusting client-supplied values (closes A&R review finding **B1**); the sign flow is now one atomic transaction (**B2**); roster cap is enforced server-side (**B5**); the dead `signed_artists_count` flags write was deleted (**B6**); ownership checks added on sign/dialogue/mood-events/PATCH artist routes. `server/routes/artists.ts` **317 → 233 lines**.
- **C40 fixed (#66)**: server-side tour-refund recompute landed — refund is now computed from `totalCost`/`plannedCities`/`remainingCities` server-side, client-supplied `refundAmount` is ignored.

**Post-merge additions (later same day):**
- **#67**: deleted ~2000 lines of dead client components.
- **#68**: projects create hardening (B1-B4) — server-side cost recompute, field whitelist, ownership check, atomic transaction; closed the `totalCost: $1` exploit.
- **#69**: ownership sweep across every remaining game-scoped router (gameLoop, games, executives, arOffice, analytics, tour, devTools) — all game-scoped routes now enforce ownership via the shared `requireGameOwner` middleware; `execId` validation added; `PATCH /api/game/:id` now field-whitelisted.
- Phase 1 plan doc moved to `COMPLETED/[COMPLETE] phase-1-server-routes-refactor-plan.md`.

**Decisions made:**
- Orchestration: parallel subagents — read-only scouts for each research review plus one mutating agent per checkout/worktree — feeding a single orchestrator that reviews before merge, same as the day-session pattern.
- Every behavior-touching PR (16, 17, 18) gets a characterization test committed green against the OLD code first, matching the PR-15 precedent.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Manual authenticated smoke pass still owed**: new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore.
- **Recording review remaining items**: B5-B7 + E-items (engine RNG determinism, no-op recorded pass, silent creation-failure UX).
- **Phase 2 (engine seams) planning can start.**

## 📅 Session Log — July 2, 2026 (Phase 1 executed: PRs 2–15, orchestrator + Opus subagent factory)

**Phase 1's entire pure-move sequence is DONE and merged, plus the first service extraction.** Ran as an orchestrator/subagent pipeline: one Opus agent per PR (Sonnet for the CI tweak), each reviewed by the orchestrator before merge. `server/routes.ts`: **5,341 → 121 lines**.

**Done this session:**
- **PRs 2–14 (pure moves) all merged** — one feature router per PR, every one verified with byte-identical route-manifest snapshot, clean `tsc`, and full vitest suite: **#42** bugReports · **#43** admin · **#44** emails (+ email zod schemas) · **#45** devTools (streaming-decay moved verbatim; TODO flags on 2 weak-auth endpoints) · **#46** content (3 public no-auth preserved) · **#47** arOffice (280-line artists handler, character-identical diff check) · **#48** executives/roles (2 legacy no-auth dialogue) · **#50** artists (fat sign-artist verbatim; `clamp` moved with dialogue handler) · **#51** projects (tour-cancel with `TODO(C40)`) · **#52** charts + tour · **#53** releases (13 endpoints, ~900 lines, relative registration order explicitly verified) · **#54** games (pickTier duplication intentionally preserved) · **#55** saves + gameLoop (`validateSnapshotCollections` → module scope in saves.ts; orphaned `select-actions` moved with phase-2 delete TODO). PRs 2–4 were stacked while merge permission was sorted; 5+ went sequentially from main.
- **routes.ts final shape**: imports + `registerRoutes()` (webhook/health/me + 17 router mounts in original registration order) + `createServer`; signature unchanged. Boot smoke on decomposed main: dev server clean, `GET /api/health` 200.
- **PR-15 gameCreationService** (**#57**, first logic change, characterization-first): new `tests/endpoints/game-creation.characterization.test.ts` (supertest, 10 tests, committed green against OLD code first, green after swap); `server/services/gameCreationService.ts` (AnalyticsService convention); POST `/api/game` handler now validate→service→respond; `pickTier` dedup verified logic-identical then removed from `GET /api/game-state` via `deriveInitialAccessTiers`; dead `defaultRoles` dropped with TODO. Suite now **555 tests**. Adds `supertest` devDep + `typeof window` guard in `tests/setup.ts` (node-env tests). vitest CI job **passed**; **auto-merge armed** pending the slow Playwright job.
- **Milestone docs PR merged** (**#56**): execution-status checklist added to the Phase 1 plan doc; `system-architecture.md` + `backend-architecture.md` now describe the feature-router layout; `ai_instructions.md` routes references fixed (file still stale overall).
- **CI: Playwright browser caching** (**#58**, Sonnet agent): `actions/cache@v4` on `~/.cache/ms-playwright` keyed on resolved `@playwright/test` version; install-deps-only on hit. First post-merge run seeds the cache; ~1–3 min savings thereafter.
- **Landed parallel-session docs** (**#49**): backlog **C40** (tour cancel trusts client `refundAmount` — fix as standalone PR now that the projects-router move is merged) + **C41** (missing `venueCapacity` bricks week advance) + `[FUTURE] tour-experience-improvement-plan.md`.

**Decisions made:**
- Full-path router convention (routers register complete paths, mounted bare at original positions, per-route auth) held for all 16 routers; import removals were grep-audited case by case.
- Merge flow: user granted `gh pr merge` permission mid-session; pure moves merged green-local per policy, PR-15 waits for CI (auto-merge armed).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **PR-15 (#57)**: confirm auto-merge completed (vitest passed; was waiting on Playwright). Then **PR-16 saveService → PR-17 releasePlanningService → PR-18 artistService**, each characterization-first, wait-for-CI. PR-16 gates on nothing (PR-14 merged).
- **Manual smoke still owed** for domains with zero HTTP coverage (plan §4 notes): authenticated pass — new game → sign artist → create project → plan release → A&R op → advance week → save/restore. Deferred throughout; do once before or right after PR-16.
- **C40 fix** (server-side refund recompute) is unblocked now — standalone PR, small.
- After PR-18: move the Phase 1 plan doc to COMPLETED, final docs sweep, then Phase 2 (engine seams) planning.
- Local env: dev server and Docker test DB (`music-label-test-db`) were **stopped** at session end. Restart with `npm run test:db:start` before running tests.

## 📅 Session Log — July 1, 2026 (Session 3 — UI overflow/layout fixes)

**Interactive UI-polish session driven from the live preview.** Played the app at non-wide window sizes, found five overflow/layout bugs, fixed and pixel-verified each in the browser, merged same-day. → **PR #40** (merged to `main`, `5023ae8`).

**Done this session:**
- **SaveGameModal scroll** — with many saves the Save & Load dialog grew past the viewport. Now capped at `max-h-[85vh]`; the saves list is the only scrollable region, with the save-name input and Export/Import/Cancel footer pinned (`client/src/components/SaveGameModal.tsx`).
- **Avatar bleed-through cropped** — on the A&R Office and Artist pages, the absolutely-positioned character avatars overlapped the translucent cards below and showed through. Fix pattern: give the avatar wrapper a height equal to its negative-top offset + `overflow-hidden`, so the image crops exactly at the card's top edge (A&R: `-top-72`/`h-72`; Artist: `-top-40` + 40px tab bar + 24px gap → `h-56`). ⚠️ **The clip height mirrors the `-top-*` offset — if you reposition an avatar, change both together.**
- **MetricsDashboard responsive fix** — the desktop 3/5/3 11-column grid started at `lg` (1024px), leaving ~60px cells that money strings overflowed and pushed past the viewport (clipping Access Tiers). Sections now stack below `xl` with `min-w-0`. Money display unified via `formatMoney`/`formatSignedMoney` helpers: whole dollars, sign before the symbol (`-$16,687`, not `$-16,687.5`) across desktop/tablet/mobile layouts.
- **MusicCalendar containment** — the events panel next to the fixed-width calendar couldn't shrink (flex `min-width:auto`), so event titles/week header spilled outside the card. Added `min-w-0` + word wrap; the panel now wraps below the calendar when the card is narrow (`basis-44`).
- **GameLayout root-cause fix** — `SidebarInset`'s flex chain lacked `min-w-0`, so any wide table's intrinsic width stretched the whole page horizontally instead of scrolling inside its `overflow-auto` wrapper (traced to a dashboard table with ~766px min-content). Fixed at the layout level in `client/src/layouts/GameLayout.tsx`, which covers **every** page.
- **Verified**: each fix measured live in the browser preview (pixel-exact crop assertions, zero horizontal overflow at 1100px and 1440px); `tsc` green. Merged without waiting for CI per user call (UI-only changes).
- **Tooling**: added machine-local `.claude/launch.json` (dev-server launch config for the preview tooling) — intentionally **not committed**.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Phase 1 PR-2..12 still queued** (server routes decomposition) — unchanged from Session 2; start with bugReports → admin → emails.
- The avatar crop pattern is per-page manual math; if more pages get overlay avatars, consider extracting a small `CroppedAvatar` component so offset and clip height can't drift apart.
- Vitest suite was **not** run this session (UI-only changes, no Docker test DB started); run it as usual before the next non-trivial change.

## 📅 Session Log — July 1, 2026 (Session 2 — architecture docs, scaling decision, Phase 0 + Phase 1 kickoff)

**The big one: decided NOT to rewrite on a game engine, and started a 4-phase scaling arc instead.** Session went: stale-docs cleanup → "should I start over with a game engine?" conversation → diagnosis (the pain is monolith debt, not the web platform) → four-phase plan → Phase 0 executed and Phase 1 begun, all merged to `main` (PRs **#36–#39**).

**Done this session:**
- **Rewrote the two stale architecture docs** — `docs/02-architecture/system-architecture.md` + `database-design.md` were pre-weekly-conversion (advanceMonth, Passport auth, fictional endpoints, `monthly_actions`). Rewrote both against current code, then **verified every claim with two code-reading subagents** (26 claims checked, 5 doc fixes applied). Committed direct to `main` (`78ff2e3`). Found in passing: `executives` seeding uses role `'head_ar'` while the schema.ts comment says `'head_of_ar'`; migration `0020` lacks the temperament CHECK (Drizzle-schema-only); `progression.json`'s `difficulty_modifiers` were dead config.
- **Backlog C39 added → resolved same day** (**PR #36**): added the missing `db:generate`/`db:studio`/`db:introspect` npm scripts (drizzle-kit 0.30.4 supports all three; CLAUDE.md + database-practices.md documented them but they never existed), fixed CLAUDE.md's `npm test` description (single run, not watch), replaced POSIX `pkill` with `npx kill-port 5000`, fixed the emergency-recovery path (`migrations/`, not `drizzle/migrations/`). Backlog: **39 items, 37 done, 2 pending** (C26 ArtistPage refactor, C32 email-snapshot cap).
- **Wired the dead difficulty multiplier** (**PR #37**): `getStartingValues(difficulty)` now applies `difficulty_modifiers.starting_money_multiplier` (easy 1.5×/normal 1.0×/hard 0.7×) via new pure helpers in `shared/utils/startingValues.ts`; `POST /api/game` accepts optional `difficulty` (default `'normal'` → zero behavior change) and persists it in `flags.difficulty`. **MISSING: no UI exposes difficulty yet** — every game still starts at $500k. 9 new unit tests.
- **Scaling decision**: player asked whether to rebuild on a game engine (Unity/Godot). Answer: **no** — management sims are menu-driven by genre (Football Manager, Game Dev Tycoon, Melvor Idle are web/UI tech); `shared/engine/GameEngine` IS the engine; the pain is monolith debt. Adopted a **4-phase arc**: Phase 0 CI safety net → Phase 1 server seams → Phase 2 engine seams → Phase 3 client state ownership → Phase 4 game feel (parallel juice track, esp. the week-advance moment).
- **Phase 0 DONE** (**PR #38**, executed by an Opus subagent): vitest suite now runs in CI as a `vitest` job in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` (`postgres:16` service on 5433 + `drizzle-kit push --force` + `npm run test:run`, ~2min). Added `tests/features/game-spine-advance-save-restore.test.ts` — the create→advance 3 weeks→save→restore→parity spine was previously uncovered end-to-end. CLAUDE.md CI note updated.
- **Phase 1 plan created** (Plan subagent, code-verified): `docs/01-planning/implementation-specs/[READY] phase-1-server-routes-refactor-plan.md` — an **18-PR strangler sequence** decomposing `server/routes.ts` (5,341 lines, 85 routes) into feature routers + services. Key findings: only ONE closure-shared helper exists (the feared extraction phase collapses); the suite had **zero HTTP-layer tests** (nothing failed if a route move dropped auth middleware); `routes/analytics.ts` + `AnalyticsService.ts` already model the target convention.
- **Phase 1 PR-1 DONE** (**PR #39**): route-manifest characterization test — walks the Express router stack after `registerRoutes()` and snapshot-locks all **84 routes with middleware chains** (70× `requireClerkUser`, 10× `requireAdmin`), plus hard assertions on `/api/admin/*` and the game-mutating core loop. Every subsequent move PR now gets wiring-regression checks from CI.
- **Validated & merged**: `tsc` green; suite **545/545 (38 files, ~26s)**; PRs #36→#39 all merged to `main` (merge order #38→#36→#37 per plan gating).

**Decisions made:**
- **Merge policy for Phase 1**: pure-move PRs (2–12) merge on green-local without blocking on CI (test-only/move changes, cheap to revert); **service-extraction PRs (15–18) wait for CI** — they change production logic.
- **GitGuardian** flags the `postgres:postgres@localhost:5433` test-DB string on every PR that adds it — **confirmed false positive** (same string has been on `main` in 3 files all along), non-blocking (`MERGEABLE`). → **Action for Nes: dismiss the incident in the GitGuardian dashboard** so it stops re-flagging Phase 1 test files.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **Phase 1 PR-2..12 are ready to execute** — pure one-domain-per-PR moves, order-independent; plan says start with the self-contained low-risk domains (bugReports → admin → emails). PR-13 (games router) and PR-15 (gameCreationService) were gated on #37, which is now merged. Full sequence + route inventory in the `[READY]` plan doc.
- **Difficulty UI** is an open product decision — the multiplier plumbing exists (easy/normal/hard), but nothing exposes it; the other three modifiers (`reputation_decay`, `market_variance`, `goal_time_extension`) remain unimplemented.
- **`ai_instructions.md` is badly stale** (Aug 2025, Neon/Replit era, wrong commands) — lightly patched this session; full reconciliation flagged as a spawn-task chip.
- **Phase 4 (game feel)** has no concrete tickets yet — first candidate: staged WeekSummary reveal with animated count-ups (Motion.dev already in stack).
- **Local env**: Docker test DB (`music-label-test-db`, port 5433) was used this session; a background watcher stops it after PR #39's CI finishes.

## 📅 Session Log — June 30, 2026 (Session 2 — PR #29: email-snapshot / save-load)

**Recovered, finished, reviewed, and hardened the orphaned Oct 2025 save/load work.** A large block of uncommitted email-snapshot / save-load / reputation work was sitting on this machine, never committed. Recovered it onto a branch and took it through merge-up-to-date → validation → manual smoke test → high-effort code review → fixes. → branch `feature/email-snapshot-save-load`, **PR #29** (open, ready for review/merge).

**Done this session:**
- **Synced `main`** — merged **PR #27** (focus-slot unlock reconciliation) and **PR #28** (untrack `.claude/settings.local.json`, gitignore it). Local `main` fast-forwarded to current. (The morning session's PRs #24/#25/#26 are also all merged now.)
- **Recovered the Oct 2025 work** onto `feature/email-snapshot-save-load` instead of discarding it: email snapshot capture + truncation safety, save-snapshot completeness (releaseSongs/executives/moodEvents/musicLabel/emails), label-based autosave naming, and reputation-change visibility in WeekSummary.
- **Brought the branch up to date with main** (it was cut from old main, 11 commits behind). Merge resolved 3 conflicts: `game-engine.ts` auto-merged cleanly (both reputation + focus-slot changes survived, verified), `technical-debt-backlog.md`, and took main's deletion of `settings.local.json`.
- **Reconciled docs with the branch code** — fixed stale `save-load-system-workflow.md` (snapshot **v2**, label-based autosave naming + read-time migration, keep-**3** autosave retention), marked the removed "Strategic Efficiency" achievement in the two analysis docs, added `REPUTATION_GAIN_ANALYSIS_2025-10-19.md`.
- **Validated**: `npm run check` green; **full vitest suite 532/532**. Required standing up the Docker test DB on **port 5433** (`music-label-test` container, db `music_label_test`) + manually adding the `artists_mood_check` CHECK constraint (`drizzle-kit push` doesn't materialize raw-SQL checks — logged as Comment 33). **Note: the vitest suite is NOT in CI — CI runs Playwright only — so it must be run locally.**
- **Manual smoke test** (drove the app, watched server logs): save→reload→restore ✅, export/import (fork + overwrite + malformed) ✅, autosave naming ✅, reputation display ⚠️ (gap → Comment 34). Found & fixed a legacy-autosave migration bug mid-test.
- **High-effort code review** (8 finder angles + verification) found **6 confirmed correctness bugs — all fixed** on the branch:
  1. autosave migration read `musicLabelName` from the wrong JSON path (`->'gameState'->'musicLabel'`; it's a top-level sibling) → migration was dead on real data; 2. autosave label fallback called a non-existent `GET /api/game/:id/label` (only POST exists); 3. week-advance email invalidation used `['emails']` which never matched the `emails:list`/`emails:unread-count` scopes (new emails lagged 30s); 4. misleading `+{amount}` badge on campaign completion; 5. import failed on single-wrapped snapshot files; 6. false `truncated` flag + redundant empty-page fetches.
- **Removed** a stray committed merge artifact `shared/engine/game-engine.ts.orig`.
- **Backlog grew** (`technical-debt-backlog.md`, now 38 items, 27 done / 11 pending): added Comments **33** (test-DB CHECK constraints), **34** (reputation visible only from press coverage), **35** (snapshot object built in two places — already diverged on `emailMetadata.truncated`), **36** (autosave-name format in 3 places), **37 ✅ done** (emailSnapshot dead/overlapping checks — resolved with fix #6), **38** (import double-validation vs Zod).

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **PR #29 is ready for review/merge** — branch is up to date with main, `tsc` green, 532/532 tests, all 6 review bugs fixed. After merging, **resync local `main`**.
- **Remaining new backlog**: Comments **33, 34, 35, 36, 38** are deferred (cleanup + product calls), not blockers. Comment 34 (reputation visibility from non-press sources) is a product/UX decision.
- **Test infra**: a future fix for Comment 33 should provision the test DB via migrations (so CHECK constraints exist) rather than bare `drizzle-kit push`; consider whether to add the vitest suite to CI.
- **Local environment left running**: the dev server and the `music-label-test` Docker container (port 5433) were started this session — stop them if not needed.

## 📅 Session Log — June 30, 2026 (Session 1 — re-orientation & docs)

**First session back after ~8 months away.** Focus was re-orientation, repo hygiene, and documentation accuracy. No gameplay/feature changes.

**Done this session:**
- **Synced local `main`** — it was 2 PRs behind `origin/main`; fast-forwarded 8 commits to `27f4d3d` (also pruned two malformed `ux-prototypes` files).
- **Fixed a TypeScript build break** — `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` default `queryFn` was typed over a too-narrow `QueryKeyWithUrl`, unassignable to TanStack's `QueryKey` slot (TS2322). Retyped over `QueryKey`; runtime URL contract still enforced by `extractUrlFromQueryKey`. `npm run check` now passes. → branch `fix/queryclient-querykey-type`, **PR #24**.
- **Reviewed all of `docs/`** (6-agent fan-out). Headline: well-organized but two-tier currency; two core flow docs still described the obsolete monthly loop.
- **Converted the two stale flow docs to the weekly (52-week) system** — `docs/03-workflows/game-system-workflows.md` + `user-interaction-flows.md`, with code-verified corrections (decay is ~15%/week not /month; weekly burn $3–6k base + ~$1,200/artist/wk; song gen Single 2/wk, EP 3/wk; starting money $500k; campaign ends week 52). → branch `docs/weekly-workflow-conversion`.
- **Fixed the `/session-end` command** (was broken: hardcoded Linux paths, frozen dates, missing files) and added this session-log convention. → branch `chore/session-workflow`.
- **Reconciled the focus-slot unlock discrepancy (quick win #1)** — collapsed the 3 conflicting values to one source of truth. Canonical = `data/balance/progression.json → progression_thresholds.fourth_focus_slot_reputation`, set to **50** (preserves the previously shipped behavior). The engine now **reads** the threshold + base + max from config instead of hardcoding (`shared/engine/game-engine.ts:349`). Deleted the misnamed week-26 `focus_slots_unlock_threshold` from `projects.json` and its loaders/type (`data/balance.ts`, `shared/utils/dataLoader.ts`, `shared/types/gameTypes.ts`, `scripts/archive/compile-balance.ts`); set the rep value to 50 in `world.json` + the `gameData.ts` sync fallback; fixed `database-design.md` (`focus_slots DEFAULT 2 → 3`). `npm run check` passes. → branch TBD.

**Open threads / next steps:**
- **(Resolved July 1, 2026) UI focus-slot cap** — Investigated end-to-end (backlog C29): the live focus-slot UI (`ExecutiveSuitePage` → `ExecutiveMeetings`/`SelectionSummary`, gated by `gameStore.selectAction()`) already honors the dynamic `gameState.focusSlots`, so the 4th slot works today — **no live bug**. Cleanup done: deleted the dead `ActionSelectionPool.tsx` + `MonthPlanner.tsx` (zero render sites) and removed a latent `.max(3)` cap on the orphaned `/api/select-actions` route (`shared/api/contracts.ts`).
- **(Historical only)** the Sept-2025 refactoring log below still says "Focus Slots: Unlock at week 26"; left as-is as a point-in-time record, but it does not reflect current behavior (reputation ≥ 50).
- **Open PRs/branches to merge or close**: PR #24 (queryClient), plus local branches `docs/weekly-workflow-conversion` and `chore/session-workflow` (not yet pushed).
- **Two open tech-debt items** (both 🔵 Low) per `docs/09-troubleshooting/technical-debt-backlog.md`: Comment 26 (`ArtistPage.tsx` is monolithic — larger refactor) and Comment 32 (email snapshot ~10k truncation cap — future enhancement). All Critical/High/Medium items are now resolved.
- **Docs still on the legacy monthly framing** in spots; index files (`docs/README.md`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`) don't list `98-research/` or `api-specifications/`.

## 🗂️ Backlog / Candidate Work
*Compiled June 30, 2026 from the docs review + onboarding. Pick from here next session.*

**Quick wins**
- [ ] **Tech-debt Comment 25** — `ClerkProvider` appearance cast to `any` in `client/src/main.tsx`; tighten typing. Small/isolated. (See `docs/09-troubleshooting/technical-debt-backlog.md`.)
- [ ] **Patch doc index files** — `docs/README.md` + `docs/CLAUDE.md` don't list `98-research/` or `api-specifications/` (invisible to navigation).
- [x] **Reconcile focus-slot unlock values** — ✅ Done June 30, 2026. Canonical source = `progression.json → fourth_focus_slot_reputation` (set to 50); engine reads threshold/base/max from config; deleted the dead week-26 `focus_slots_unlock_threshold`. See session log above.

**Medium**
- [ ] **Verify the financial bug** — `docs/98-research/FINANCIAL_CALCULATION_BUG_ANALYSIS.md` documents a dual-path revenue/expense bug; confirm whether it was fixed in current code.
- [ ] **Tech-debt Comment 26** — `client/src/pages/ArtistPage.tsx` is monolithic; split into memoized subcomponents. Larger refactor.
- [ ] **Add a GameEngine architecture doc** — `02-architecture/` has no dedicated doc for the core shared `GameEngine`, despite its centrality.

**Feature threads** (from `docs/01-planning/`)
- [ ] **Artist-mood plan** — paused after Phase 5 (Oct 12, 2025), resumable. (`implementation-specs/[IN-PROGRESS] artist-mood-plan.md`)
- [ ] **Artist-contract-system refactor** — flagged as next target; dependency map exists (`implementation-specs/artist-contract-system-dependencies.md`).

**Housekeeping**
- [ ] Merge open PRs **#24** (queryClient fix), **#25** (weekly-workflow docs), **#26** (session workflow), then resync local `main`.

## 🚀 **MAJOR SYSTEM REFACTORING - SEPTEMBER 24, 2025**

### **MASSIVE MONTH-TO-WEEK CONVERSION COMPLETE**
**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** - Entire game system successfully converted from monthly to weekly progression

**Scope**: 1,600+ individual code changes across entire codebase transforming game from monthly cycles to weekly cycles

#### **✅ Core Architecture Changes**
- **Game Progression**: Monthly turns → Weekly turns (4x faster progression)
- **Campaign Duration**: 36 months → 52 weeks (full calendar year simulation)
- **Chart System**: 12 monthly chart periods → 52 weekly charts (true weekly chart updates)
- **Seasonal System**: Monthly seasonal effects → Weekly seasonal effects with proper quarterly mapping
- **Database Schema**: All month-based columns renamed to week-based (current_month → current_week, etc.)

#### **✅ Terminology Refactoring (1,600+ Changes)**
**Phase 1: Interface & Type Renames**
- `MonthSummary` → `WeekSummary` (68 instances)
- `MonthlyOutcome` → `WeeklyOutcome`
- `MonthlyFinancials` → `WeeklyFinancials`

**Phase 2: Property Renames**
- `currentMonth` → `currentWeek` (200+ instances)
- `dueMonth` → `dueWeek`
- `startMonth` → `startWeek`
- `releaseMonth` → `releaseWeek` (81 instances)
- `foundedMonth` → `foundedWeek` (7 instances)

**Phase 3: Function Renames**
- `calculateMonthlyBurn` → `calculateWeeklyBurn` (6 instances)
- `monthsSinceRelease` → `weeksSinceRelease` (8 instances)
- `getMonthlyStats` → `getWeeklyStats` (2 instances)

**Phase 4: UI Terminology**
- `month` → `week` (753 instances)
- `Month` → `Week` (450 instances)

#### **✅ Database Migration**
- **Drizzle Kit Push**: All database columns successfully renamed using interactive migration
- **Schema Consistency**: Code terminology now perfectly matches database column names
- **Data Preservation**: All existing game data preserved during column renames
- **Tables Updated**: `game_states`, `artists`, `projects`, `songs`, `releases`, `executives`

#### **✅ Chart System Refactoring**
- **Weekly Charts**: Converted from 12 monthly chart periods to 52 weekly chart periods
- **Chart Generation**: Updated `generateChartWeekFromGameWeek()` from 12-week to 52-week cycle
- **Chart Service**: Fixed `toDbDate()` method and year transition logic
- **Chart Storage**: Now supports 4x more granular chart data (weekly instead of monthly)

#### **✅ Seasonal System Unification**
- **DRY Principle Applied**: Eliminated 4+ duplicate seasonal calculation sources
- **Single Source of Truth**: `balance.json` seasonal_modifiers used by all systems
- **Unified Logic**: Created `shared/utils/seasonalCalculations.ts` for all seasonal calculations
- **52-Week Quarters**: Q1 (weeks 1-13), Q2 (14-26), Q3 (27-39), Q4 (40-52)
- **Consistent Percentages**: All displays now show unified seasonal multipliers (Q4: +40%, Q1: -15%, etc.)

#### **✅ UI Component Enhancements**
- **WeekPicker Component**: Created reusable 52-week visual picker replacing dropdown selectors
- **Pure Component Architecture**: WeekPicker handles selection, parent components handle seasonal logic
- **Seasonal Visual Interface**: Quarter-based week layout with hover tooltips and seasonal indicators
- **Lead Single Support**: Independent week selection for EP releases with lead single strategies

#### **✅ End Game System Updates**
- **Campaign Length**: 52-week campaigns (full calendar year) instead of 36-week campaigns
- **Focus Slots**: Unlock at week 26 (halfway point) instead of week 18
- **Game Completion**: Dynamic completion using balance config (automatically ends at week 52)
- **UI Displays**: All "Week X/52" displays updated throughout interface

#### **✅ Technical Achievements**
- **Zero Downtime**: Game remained functional throughout 1,600+ code changes
- **DRY Architecture**: Eliminated all duplicate seasonal calculation logic
- **Configuration-Driven**: All timing logic now uses balance.json configuration
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript interfaces updated for weekly system
- **Database Consistency**: Perfect alignment between code and database schema
- **Documentation Updated**: All current documentation reflects weekly system

#### **🎯 Business Impact**
- **4x Faster Progression**: Weekly decisions instead of monthly (much more engaging)
- **Full Calendar Year**: 52-week campaigns cover complete seasonal cycles
- **Strategic Depth**: Quarterly release planning with seasonal multipliers
- **True Weekly Charts**: Charts update weekly like real music industry
- **Enhanced Gameplay**: More frequent decision points and faster feedback loops

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation Approach**
1. **Strategic Bulk Refactoring**: Used Cursor's search/replace for 1,600+ systematic changes
2. **Incremental Commits**: Each phase committed separately for easy rollback
3. **Database Migration**: Used Drizzle Kit for safe column renames
4. **DRY Refactoring**: Consolidated all seasonal logic into shared utilities
5. **Component Extraction**: Created reusable WeekPicker for future features

**Result**: Game now operates on true weekly cycles with complete consistency across code, database, UI, and documentation. This massive refactoring maintains all existing functionality while providing 4x faster, more engaging gameplay progression.

### **September 2025 - Song Quality System Enhancements**
- ✅ **Budget Impact Dampening System** - Reduced budget's dominance over quality calculations
  - ✅ Implemented configurable dampening factor (0.7) in quality.json
  - ✅ Reduces budget's impact on quality by 30% while maintaining strategic importance
  - ✅ Formula: `efficiencyRatio = 1 + 0.7 × (rawRatio - 1)` keeps ratio=1 neutral
  - ✅ Budget multiplier now ranges from 0.65x to ~1.35x (was 0.65x to 1.5x+)
  - ✅ Updated FinancialSystem.ts with dampening in both calculateBudgetQualityMultiplier and getBudgetEfficiencyRating
  - ✅ Synchronized ProjectCreationModal.tsx to apply same dampening in UI preview
  - ✅ Updated QualityTester.tsx testing interface with dampened calculations
- ✅ **Enhanced Variance System with Outliers** - More dramatic and exciting quality outcomes

  - ✅ Formula updated: `baseVarianceRange = 35 - (30 × combinedSkill/100)`
  - ✅ Added 10% chance for outlier events:
    - 5% Breakout Hit: 1.5x-2.0x multiplier (bigger boost for lower skill)
    - 5% Critical Failure: 0.5x-0.7x multiplier (high skill has protection)
  - ✅ 90% of songs use normal skill-based variance for consistency
  - ✅ Creates high-risk/high-reward dynamics for amateur artists

### **September 5, 2025 - Budget Quality Calculation System Overhaul**
- ✅ **Fixed Piecewise Function Calculation Errors** - Corrected budget factor multiplier calculations
  - ✅ Fixed incorrect segment calculations that were causing cumulative errors (was 1.34, now correctly 1.14)
  - ✅ Replaced additive slope calculations with explicit start/end multiplier values for each segment
  - ✅ All 6 segments now properly interpolate: penalty (0.65), below standard (0.65-0.85), efficient (0.85-1.05), premium (1.05-1.20), luxury (1.20-1.35), diminishing (1.35+)
- ✅ **Removed Double-Counting of Producer/Time Multipliers** - Fixed economic calibration issue
  - ✅ Producer and time multipliers now only apply to project cost (what player pays)
  - ✅ Removed these multipliers from minimum viable cost calculation (quality baseline)
  - ✅ Added 1.5x baseline quality multiplier for recording sessions to properly calibrate system
  - ✅ Result: Minimum budget with cheapest options now gives appropriate -17% quality penalty instead of +14% bonus
- ✅ **Frontend-Backend Synchronization** - Complete consistency across the stack
  - ✅ Updated `ProjectCreationModal.tsx` to match backend's corrected piecewise function
  - ✅ Frontend `calculateDynamicMinimumViableCost()` now identical to backend implementation
  - ✅ Both use same formula: Base × Economies × 1.5 (no producer/time multipliers)
  - ✅ Verified with comprehensive test suite showing identical calculations
- ✅ **Skill-Based Quality Variance System** - More realistic randomization
  - ✅ Implemented dynamic variance based on combined artist talent and producer skill
  - ✅ Low skill (35 avg): ±13.7% variance - high risk/reward, potential breakout hits or failures
  - ✅ Mid skill (58 avg): ±9.7% variance - moderately consistent quality
  - ✅ High skill (78 avg): ±6% variance - very reliable professional output
  - ✅ Elite skill (95 avg): ±2.9% variance - extremely consistent, "they don't miss"
  - ✅ Formula: Variance = 20% - (18% × CombinedSkill/100), applied per song individually
- ✅ **Economic Balance Improvements**
  - ✅ Minimum selectable budget now appropriately penalizes quality (as intended)
  - ✅ Higher budgets provide meaningful quality bonuses without being excessive
  - ✅ Strategic trade-offs between budget, producer quality, and time investment
  - ✅ No more gaming the system with minimum budget for quality bonuses
- ✅ **Technical Implementation Details**
  - ✅ Maintained separation of concerns: project costs include multipliers, quality baseline doesn't
  - ✅ Each song in multi-song projects gets individual random variance (realistic album variation)
  - ✅ All changes backward compatible with existing save games
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with multiple scenario validations

- ✅ **Performance Improvements Achieved**
  - ✅ Eliminated recalculation on every render - calculations now cached for 1 minute
  - ✅ 50% reduction in dashboard load time for primary components (ActiveProjects, ArtistRoster)
  - ✅ Database queries use indexed columns instead of JSON field searches (10-100x faster)
  - ✅ Frontend components now display pre-calculated data instead of computing on-the-fly
- ⚠️ **Known Deviations from Original Spec** (Documented for future work)
  - ⚠️ `releaseAnalytics.ts` still calculates ROI locally for ReleaseWorkflowCard (works on in-memory data)
  - ⚠️ Configuration service not implemented - business rules remain hardcoded
  - ⚠️ No Redis L2 cache or materialized views - L1 cache sufficient for current scale
  - ⚠️ Batch analytics endpoint not needed due to React Query caching effectiveness
- ✅ **Technical Implementation Details**
  - ✅ Leveraged database generated columns (`roiPercentage`, `totalInvestment`) for consistency
  - ✅ Used established foreign key relationships (projectId) for fast indexed lookups
