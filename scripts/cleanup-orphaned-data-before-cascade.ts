/**
 * Cleanup Orphaned Data Before CASCADE Schema Migration
 *
 * This script cleans up orphaned records that reference non-existent game_states
 * BEFORE applying CASCADE foreign key constraints. This prevents the migration
 * from failing due to existing constraint violations.
 *
 * Tables to clean:
 * - artists (gameId references game_states)
 * - projects (gameId references game_states)
 * - roles (gameId references game_states)
 * - executives (gameId references game_states)
 * - moodEvents (gameId references game_states)
 * - weeklyActions (gameId references game_states)
