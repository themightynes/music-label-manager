Based on the comprehensive onboarding documentation I've just processed, here's your session-ready summary:

## üéØ Project Overview
**Top Roles: Music Label Manager** is a **98% complete MVP** strategic simulation game where players run their own record label. The game features:

- **Complete 12-month campaign** with turn-based progression
- **Artist discovery and signing** with 6 unique artists
- **Project creation workflow** (Singles, EPs, Mini-Tours)
- **Role-based dialogue system** with 8 industry professionals
- **Resource management** and access tier progression
- **Save/load system** with multiple slots and JSON export

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Zustand + React Query
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (Neon) + Drizzle ORM
- **Shared**: Unified GameEngine + Zod validation + type-safe API contracts
- **Content**: JSON-based content management in `/data/` directory

## üö® Critical Session Rules
1. **Never start background processes** without explicit user permission
2. **Use static analysis tools** (Read, Glob, Grep) for code reviews
3. **Ask before starting dev server**: "Should I start the dev server?"
4. **Always clean up** background processes at session end

## üìÅ Key Documentation Locations
- **Strategic Planning**: `docs/01-planning/` - Original vision and requirements
- **Technical Implementation**: `docs/02-07/` - Complete architecture and workflows  
- **Session Rules**: `docs/99-legacy/ClaudeCodeInstructions.md`
- **Current Status**: `MVP_STATUS.md` - Detailed completion assessment

## üéØ Role-Based Quick Starts

**For Strategic Work**: Read planning docs ‚Üí understand game vision ‚Üí align decisions
**For Development**: Read setup docs ‚Üí check current state ‚Üí follow established patterns
**For Content**: Read content system docs ‚Üí edit JSON files ‚Üí validate changes

## ‚úÖ MVP Achievement (100% Complete - August 2025)

## üöÄ Ready to Work!

I'm now fully oriented on the Music Label Manager project. The **MVP was completed in August 2025** and we're now in the post-MVP development phase focusing on advanced features. I understand both the achieved MVP foundation and the strategic roadmap for sophisticated feature expansion.

**What would you like to work on?** I can help with:
- Code analysis and reviews
- Feature implementation following established patterns
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- Content modifications in the JSON system
