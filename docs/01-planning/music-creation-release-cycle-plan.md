## üìã Executive Summary

The **Music Creation & Release Cycle** is the **FOUNDATION** feature that transforms the game from simple project management to a sophisticated music industry simulation. This feature introduces **multi-song tracking**, **strategic release timing**, and **catalog building mechanics** that make every decision meaningful.

**Priority**: ‚≠ê **CRITICAL - All other systems serve this loop**

---

## üéØ Core Feature Requirements (From Roadmap)

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Multi-song project tracking per artist** - Artists create individual songs that can be released strategically
2. **Strategic single selection** - Choose which songs to release as singles vs. save for albums
3. **EP/Album compilation** - Bundle 3-5 songs into EPs, 8-12 songs into albums
4. **Release timing strategy** - When to release what type of content for maximum impact
5. **Song quality system** - Each song has individual quality affecting success

### **Release Types**
- **Single**: 1 song, quick release, builds buzz
- **EP**: 3-5 songs, moderate investment, sustains momentum  
- **Album**: 8-12 songs, major investment, establishes artistic legacy
- **Compilation**: Mix of previously released songs, cash-in opportunity

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Database Schema Changes**

#### **New Table: songs**
```sql
CREATE TABLE songs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  artist_id UUID REFERENCES artists(id),
  game_id UUID REFERENCES game_states(id),
  quality INTEGER (20-100),
  genre TEXT,
  mood TEXT, -- upbeat, melancholic, aggressive, chill
  created_month INTEGER,
  producer_tier TEXT, -- local, regional, national, legendary
  time_investment TEXT, -- rushed, standard, extended, perfectionist
  is_recorded BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_released BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  release_id UUID, -- links to releases table
  metadata JSONB -- hooks, features, special attributes
);
```

#### **New Table: releases**
```sql
CREATE TABLE releases (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT, -- single, ep, album, compilation
  artist_id UUID REFERENCES artists(id),
  game_id UUID REFERENCES game_states(id),
  release_month INTEGER,
  total_quality INTEGER, -- aggregate of song qualities
  marketing_budget INTEGER,
  status TEXT, -- planned, released, catalog
  revenue_generated INTEGER,
  streams_generated INTEGER,
  peak_chart_position INTEGER,
  metadata JSONB -- track listing, bonus content, etc
);
```

#### **New Table: release_songs** (Junction)
```sql
CREATE TABLE release_songs (
  release_id UUID REFERENCES releases(id),
  song_id UUID REFERENCES songs(id),
  track_number INTEGER,
  is_single BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- was this pushed as a single?
  PRIMARY KEY (release_id, song_id)
);
```

#### **Modify projects table**
- Add `song_count INTEGER` - tracks how many songs to create
- Add `songs_created INTEGER DEFAULT 0` - progress tracking
- Change workflow to generate songs instead of direct release

## üéÆ User Experience - Phase 1 (Functional MVP)

### **Step 1: Project Creation (Recording Session)**

**When user clicks "Start Project":**
1. **Choose Artist** - Select from roster
2. **Choose Recording Type**:
   - **Singles Session** (1-3 songs) - $3k-8k per song
   - **EP Session** (3-5 songs) - $15k-25k total  
   - **Album Session** (8-12 songs) - $30k-60k total
3. **Select Producer Tier** (Future: Sprint 2)
   - For now: Standard quality only
4. **Set Time Investment** (Future: Sprint 2)
   - For now: Standard time only
5. **Confirm Budget** and start recording

**UI Changes**:
- ProjectCreationModal shows song quantity selector
- Budget calculated as: (base_cost_per_song √ó song_count √ó quality_multiplier)
- Timeline shows: Recording (1-2 months) ‚Üí Mixing (1 month) ‚Üí Ready for release

### **Step 2: Song Generation (During Recording)**

**Monthly Processing**:
- Each month of recording generates 2-4 songs (based on session type)
- Each song gets:
  - **Auto-generated name** (from pool: "Midnight Dreams", "City Lights", etc.)
  - **Quality score** (base 40-60 + artist mood + producer bonus + time bonus)
  - **Genre** (matches artist primary genre)
  - **Mood** (random from artist's style)

**UI Addition**: 
- New "Song Catalog" tab in artist details showing all recorded songs
- Status badges: "Recording", "Ready", "Released"

### **Step 3: Release Strategy (New Action Type)**

**New Monthly Action: "Plan Release"**
1. **Select Artist** with ready songs
2. **Choose Release Type**:
   - **Single** - Pick 1 song, immediate release
   - **EP** - Pick 3-5 songs, create tracklist
   - **Album** - Pick 8-12 songs, create tracklist, choose lead single
3. **Set Marketing Budget** ($1k-20k)
4. **Choose Release Timing**:
   - Immediate (next month)
   - Strategic delay (2-3 months, build anticipation)

**UI Components**:
- New ReleaseStrategyModal
- Song picker with quality indicators
- Tracklist ordering drag-and-drop
- Preview of projected outcomes

### **Step 4: Release & Catalog Building**

**On Release**:
- Single/EP/Album enters market
- Generates initial revenue (existing calculation)
- Songs marked as "released"
- Begins revenue decay (already implemented!)

**Catalog View**:
- Shows all releases by artist
- Monthly revenue from each release (with decay)
- Total catalog value
- Suggested next moves ("Artist has 5 unreleased songs - consider EP")

## üîÑ Game Loop Impact

### **Strategic Decisions**

**Players must decide:**
1. **Recording Strategy**: Many singles or save for album?
2. **Quality vs Quantity**: Few great songs or many good ones?
3. **Release Timing**: Flood market or strategic spacing?
4. **Single Selection**: Which song has hit potential?
5. **Catalog Balance**: New content vs. maximizing existing?

### **Economic Impact**
- **Singles** generate quick revenue but decay fast
- **EPs** sustain artist momentum with moderate investment
- **Albums** are expensive but create lasting catalog value
- **Multiple singles** from same album session = extended revenue

### **Progression Unlocks**
- 10+ songs recorded ‚Üí Unlock compilation option
- 3 successful singles ‚Üí Unlock "Greatest Hits" package
- High-quality album ‚Üí Unlocks "Deluxe Edition" re-release

---

## üìä Balance Configuration

### **New balance.json sections**
```json
{
  "song_generation": {
    "songs_per_month": {
      "single_session": 1,
      "ep_session": 2,
      "album_session": 3
    },
    "quality_variance": [-10, 10],
    "name_pools": {
      "pop": ["Midnight Dreams", "City Lights", "Hearts on Fire"],
      "rock": ["Thunder Road", "Broken Chains", "Rebel Soul"],
      "electronic": ["Digital Love", "Neon Nights", "System Override"]
    }
  },
  "release_bonuses": {
    "single_focus_bonus": 1.2, // Marketing concentrated on one song
    "album_cohesion_bonus": 1.15, // Thematic consistency
    "ep_flexibility": 1.1, // Good balance
    "compilation_nostalgia": 1.3 // For older successful songs
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION GAP FIXES**

### **üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration Strategy**

#### **Migration Sequence (CRITICAL ORDER)**
```sql
-- Migration 1: Add song_count/songs_created to existing projects table
ALTER TABLE projects 
ADD COLUMN song_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
ADD COLUMN songs_created INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Migration 2: Create releases table (no dependencies)
CREATE TABLE releases (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('single', 'ep', 'album', 'compilation')),
  artist_id UUID REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  game_id UUID REFERENCES game_states(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  release_month INTEGER,
  total_quality INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  marketing_budget INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'planned' CHECK (status IN ('planned', 'released', 'catalog')),
  revenue_generated INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  streams_generated INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  peak_chart_position INTEGER,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Migration 3: Create songs table (depends on releases)
CREATE TABLE songs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  artist_id UUID REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  game_id UUID REFERENCES game_states(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  quality INTEGER CHECK (quality >= 20 AND quality <= 100),
  genre TEXT,
  mood TEXT,
  created_month INTEGER,
  producer_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'local',
  time_investment TEXT DEFAULT 'standard',
  is_recorded BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_released BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  release_id UUID REFERENCES releases(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Migration 4: Create junction table (depends on both)
CREATE TABLE release_songs (
  release_id UUID REFERENCES releases(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  song_id UUID REFERENCES songs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  track_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  is_single BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  PRIMARY KEY (release_id, song_id)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_songs_artist_game ON songs(artist_id, game_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_songs_release ON songs(release_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_releases_artist_game ON releases(artist_id, game_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_release_songs_release ON release_songs(release_id);
```

#### **Legacy Data Handling**
```sql
-- Update existing projects to have default song counts based on type
UPDATE projects 
SET song_count = CASE 
  WHEN type = 'Single' THEN 1
  WHEN type = 'EP' THEN 4  
  WHEN type = 'Mini-Tour' THEN 0  -- Tours don't create songs
  ELSE 1
END
WHERE song_count IS NULL;

-- Mark existing projects as completed song creation
UPDATE projects 
SET songs_created = song_count
WHERE stage = 'released' AND songs_created = 0;
```

### **üîÑ Revenue Integration Strategy**

#### **Modified GameEngine Architecture**
```typescript
// EXISTING: calculateProjectOutcomes() handles project-based revenue
// NEW: Split revenue calculation into two systems

class GameEngine {
  // NEW METHOD: Handle song-based revenue separately  
  calculateSongRevenue(gameState: GameState): number {
    // Apply to songs from releases, not projects
    return this.processReleasedProjects(gameState); // Use existing decay logic
  }
  
  // MODIFIED: Only handle non-song projects (tours, etc.)
  calculateProjectOutcomes(gameState: GameState): ProjectOutcome[] {
    return projects
      .filter(p => p.type === 'Mini-Tour') // Only tours, not Singles/EPs
      .map(p => this.calculateProjectRevenue(p));
  }
  
  // NEW METHOD: Bridge between old and new systems
  processMonthlyRevenue(gameState: GameState): number {
    const projectRevenue = this.calculateProjectOutcomes(gameState)
      .reduce((sum, outcome) => sum + outcome.revenue, 0);
    const songRevenue = this.calculateSongRevenue(gameState);
    return projectRevenue + songRevenue;
  }
}
```

### **‚è∞ Song Generation Timing Integration**

#### **Monthly Processing Cycle Integration**
```typescript
// EXISTING: processMonthlyActions() runs all monthly logic
// NEW: Add song generation to existing cycle

class GameEngine {
  processMonthlyActions(gameState: GameState): GameState {
    // EXISTING monthly processing...
    
    // NEW: Add song generation to monthly cycle
    const updatedProjects = gameState.projects.map(project => {
      if (this.isRecordingProject(project) && this.shouldGenerateSongs(project)) {
        return this.generateMonthlyProjectSongs(project, gameState);
      }
      return project;
    });
    
    // Continue with existing monthly processing...
    return { ...gameState, projects: updatedProjects };
  }
  
  private isRecordingProject(project: Project): boolean {
    return ['Single', 'EP'].includes(project.type) && 
           project.stage === 'production' &&
           (project.metadata?.isRecording ?? false);
  }
  
  private shouldGenerateSongs(project: Project): boolean {
    const songsCreated = project.metadata?.songs_created ?? 0;
    const targetSongs = project.song_count ?? 1;
    return songsCreated < targetSongs;
  }
}
```

### **üéõÔ∏è UI State Management Strategy**

#### **Artist Details Component Integration**
```typescript
// EXISTING: ArtistDetails component shows basic artist info
// NEW: Add song catalog without breaking existing structure

interface ArtistDetailsProps {
  artist: Artist;
  // NEW: Optional song catalog data
  songCatalog?: Song[];
  onSongSelect?: (song: Song) => void;
}

// NEW: Separate SongCatalog component to avoid state conflicts
const SongCatalog = ({ artistId, gameId }: { artistId: string; gameId: string }) => {
  const [songs, setSongs] = useState<Song[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  // Load songs independently to avoid blocking artist details
  useEffect(() => {
    loadArtistSongs(artistId, gameId).then(setSongs).finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, [artistId, gameId]);
  
  if (loading) return <SongCatalogSkeleton />;
  return <SongList songs={songs} />;
};
```

### **‚úÖ Release Validation Business Logic**

#### **Duplicate Release Prevention**
```typescript
class ReleaseValidator {
  static validateRelease(release: NewRelease, existingSongs: Song[]): ValidationResult {
    const errors: string[] = [];
    
    // Prevent releasing already-released songs
    const alreadyReleased = release.songIds.filter(id => 
      existingSongs.find(s => s.id === id)?.is_released
    );
    if (alreadyReleased.length > 0) {
      errors.push(`Songs already released: ${alreadyReleased.join(', ')}`);
    }
    
    // Validate song count for release type
    const songCount = release.songIds.length;
    if (release.type === 'single' && songCount !== 1) {
      errors.push('Singles must contain exactly 1 song');
    }
    if (release.type === 'ep' && (songCount < 3 || songCount > 5)) {
      errors.push('EPs must contain 3-5 songs');
    }
    if (release.type === 'album' && (songCount < 8 || songCount > 12)) {
      errors.push('Albums must contain 8-12 songs');
    }
    
    return { isValid: errors.length === 0, errors };
  }
}
```

### **üí∞ Budget Flow Clarification**

#### **Separate Recording vs Marketing Budgets**
```typescript
interface ProjectBudget {
  // RECORDING PHASE: Paid upfront when starting project
  recordingCost: number;  // Covers: studio time, producer, mixing
  recordingPaid: boolean; // Deducted from gameState.money immediately
}

interface ReleaseBudget {
  // MARKETING PHASE: Paid when releasing songs
  marketingBudget: number;  // Covers: promotion, distribution, advertising
  marketingPaid: boolean;   // Deducted when release is executed
}

// Clear separation: Projects cost money to record, Releases cost money to market
```

---

## üî® Technical Implementation Details

### **API Endpoints Needed**
```typescript
// New endpoints
POST /api/songs/generate        // Generate songs during recording
GET  /api/songs/catalog/:artistId  // Get artist's song catalog
POST /api/releases/plan         // Plan a new release
PUT  /api/releases/:id/execute  // Execute release plan
GET  /api/releases/catalog      // Get all releases for game

// Modified endpoints
POST /api/projects/start        // Now supports song_count parameter
```

### **New Zod Schemas**
```typescript
export const SongSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  title: z.string(),
  artistId: z.string().uuid(),
  quality: z.number().min(20).max(100),
  genre: z.string(),
  mood: z.string(),
  // ... other fields
});

export const ReleaseSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  title: z.string(),
  type: z.enum(['single', 'ep', 'album', 'compilation']),
  songIds: z.array(z.string().uuid()),
  // ... other fields
});
```

### **Game Engine Changes**
- Modify `processProjectStart()` to create song generation schedule
- Add `generateSongs()` method for monthly song creation
- Add `planRelease()` method for release strategy
- Update `calculateProjectOutcomes()` to handle song-based releases

---

## üîó Integration Points

### **With Existing Systems**
- **Revenue Decay**: Already implemented - will apply to all release types
- **Artist Mood**: Affects song quality during generation
- **Access Tiers**: Affects release success (existing playlist/press/venue system)
- **Marketing Budget**: Applied to releases instead of projects

### **With Future Systems**
- **Producer Tiers**: Will modify song quality during generation
- **Time Investment**: Will affect recording speed and quality
- **Seasonal Modifiers**: Will influence release timing decisions
- **Regional Markets**: Will expand release strategy options

---

## üìù Development Notes

### **Critical Design Decisions**
1. **Songs vs Projects**: Songs are the atomic unit, projects are recording sessions
2. **Release Independence**: Releases are separate from recording projects
3. **Quality Aggregation**: Album quality = average of song qualities with bonuses
4. **Marketing Split**: Marketing budget applies to releases, not recording
5. **Catalog Persistence**: All songs remain in catalog for future use

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Database Performance**: Index on game_id, artist_id, release_month for queries
- **UI Complexity**: Phase releases to avoid overwhelming users
- **Balance Tuning**: Externalize all numbers to balance.json
- **Migration Safety**: Test schema changes thoroughly with existing data

### **üß™ Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

#### **Phase 1 Testing Checklist**

**Database & Migration Testing:**
- [ ] **Migration Rollback Safety**: Test each migration step with rollback capability

- [ ] **Authentication**: New endpoints respect existing auth middleware

**Game Engine Integration Testing:**
- [ ] **Monthly Processing**: Song generation doesn't break existing monthly cycle
- [ ] **Revenue Calculation**: New song revenue integrates with existing project revenue
- [ ] **GameState Consistency**: Game state remains valid after song generation
- [ ] **Project Completion**: Recording projects complete properly when songs are created
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Handle projects with 0 songs, deleted artists, corrupted metadata

**UI Component Testing:**
- [ ] **Artist Details Integration**: SongCatalog component loads without breaking existing UI
- [ ] **ProjectCreationModal**: Song quantity selection works with existing project types
- [ ] **State Management**: Loading states for song catalogs don't conflict with artist loading
- [ ] **Performance**: Large song catalogs (50+ songs) render smoothly
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: New components work on mobile and desktop

**Business Logic Testing:**
- [ ] **Release Validation**: Cannot release same song twice
- [ ] **Song Quality Calculation**: Artist mood + producer + time bonuses work correctly
- [ ] **Budget Separation**: Recording costs vs marketing costs properly separated
- [ ] **Revenue Decay Integration**: Song releases properly feed into existing decay system
- [ ] **Balance Configuration**: New balance.json sections load and apply correctly

**User Experience Testing:**
- [ ] **Recording Flow**: User can create multi-song projects and see progress
- [ ] **Song Catalog**: Users can view and understand their song inventory
- [ ] **Release Planning**: Users can select songs for releases intuitively
- [ ] **Financial Clarity**: Budget separation is clear to users
- [ ] **Performance Feedback**: Quality improvements visible during recording

**Data Consistency Testing:**
- [ ] **Cross-Table Integrity**: Songs, releases, and release_songs stay synchronized
- [ ] **Game Save Compatibility**: New song data saves/loads correctly with existing games
- [ ] **Artist Deletion**: Properly handle artist deletion with existing songs
- [ ] **Game Reset**: New game creation works with song system in place
- [ ] **Monthly Progression**: Month transitions handle song generation correctly

#### **Test Data Scenarios**

**Legacy Game State Testing:**
```typescript
// Test with existing game saves that have:
- Projects in various stages (planning, production, released)
- Different project types (Single, EP, Mini-Tour)
- Released projects with existing revenue streams
- Artists with various mood/loyalty states
```

**Edge Case Scenarios:**
```typescript
// Test scenarios:
- Artist with 50+ recorded songs
- Album project spanning 4+ months of recording
- Simultaneous recording projects for same artist
- Release with songs from different recording sessions
- Game save from before song system implementation
```

**Performance Benchmarks:**
```typescript
// Database query performance targets:
- Artist song catalog load: < 200ms
- Release catalog with 100+ releases: < 500ms
- Monthly processing with 10+ recording projects: < 1s
- Game save with full song database: < 2s
```
