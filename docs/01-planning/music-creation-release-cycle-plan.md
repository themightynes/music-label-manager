## üìã Feature Overview

The **Music Creation & Release Cycle** is the **FOUNDATION** feature that transforms the game from simple project management to a sophisticated music industry simulation. This feature introduces **multi-song tracking**, **strategic release timing**, and **catalog building mechanics** that make every decision meaningful.

---

## üéØ Core Feature Requirements

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Multi-song project tracking per artist** - Artists create individual songs that can be released strategically
2. **Strategic single selection** - Choose which songs to release as singles vs. save for albums
3. **EP/Album compilation** - Bundle 3-5 songs into EPs, 8-12 songs into albums
4. **Release timing strategy** - When to release what type of content for maximum impact
5. **Song quality system** - Each song has individual quality affecting success

### **Release Types**
- **Single**: 1 song, quick release, builds buzz
- **EP**: 3-5 songs, moderate investment, sustains momentum  
- **Album**: 8-12 songs, major investment, establishes artistic legacy
- **Compilation**: Mix of previously released songs, cash-in opportunity

## üìù Lessons Learned

### **Phase 1 Insights**
1. **Implementation Order**: Building the song generation system before the release strategy UI was the right approach
2. **Database Design**: The three-table structure (songs, releases, release_songs) provides excellent flexibility
3. **User Feedback**: The "X Total | Y Ready | Z Released" display format is intuitive
4. **Quality System**: Stacking producer tier + time investment + budget bonuses creates meaningful choices

### **Phase 2 Insights** 
1. **Balance.json Integration**: Driving all calculations through balance.json prevented hardcoding and enables easy balancing
2. **Real-time Calculations**: Sub-50ms response time for complex marketing formulas creates fluid user experience
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Showing basic preview first, then detailed breakdown reduces cognitive load
4. **Transaction Safety**: Database rollback mechanisms crucial for handling complex multi-table operations
5. **Channel Synergies**: Marketing channel combinations create emergent strategic depth beyond simple budget allocation
6. **Seasonal Strategy**: Calendar-based multipliers add temporal planning dimension to release strategy
7. **Song Filtering Fix**: Proper `releaseId IS NULL` filtering in ready songs API essential for preventing false conflict detection in single releases
