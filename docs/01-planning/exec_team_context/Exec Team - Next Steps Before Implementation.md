## ✅**1. Create Detailed Executive Personalities & Narrative Voice Profiles**
[[Exec Team - Character Bible]]
Before coding, you need to fully flesh out WHO these executives are as characters:

- **Write backstories** for each executive (where they came from, their industry experience)
- **Define distinct speaking styles** (CMO might use marketing buzzwords, CCO uses artistic language)
- **Create personality quirks** that affect their proposals (A&R always champions underdogs, Distribution Head is obsessed with data)
- **Map their growth arcs** - how do they change from Level 1 to Level 10?
- **Write sample dialogue** for each executive at different mood states
- **Define their failure personalities** - how do they deliver bad news or handle mistakes?

This ensures consistent, engaging narrative content throughout development.

## **✅2. Design & Balance 15-20 Specific Executive Actions (3-4 per Executive)**
[[Exec Team - Actions - COMPLETE MECHANICAL FRAMEWORK]]
Map out the actual mechanical choices players will face:

- **Create action templates** with all variables defined:

- Name and narrative description
- Costs (money ranges, creative capital requirements)
- Success rates and risk factors
- Timing (immediate/delayed/ongoing)
- Effect magnitudes at different executive levels

- **Design interesting trade-offs** (e.g., A&R's "Poach Rival Talent" - high cost, damages reputation, but gets proven artist)
- **Create action progression** - how do options change/improve with executive levels?
- **Map edge cases** - what happens if player can't afford the results of a delayed action?
- **Define failure outcomes** - not just "nothing happens" but interesting setbacks

This gives you a complete mechanical framework before touching code.

## **3. Prototype the Month-to-Month Executive Impact Flow on Paper**

Run a paper simulation of 12 months with the executive system:

- **Create a spreadsheet** simulating months 1-12
- **Track all resources** (money, reputation, creative capital, artists)
- **Play through different strategies**:

- CMO-heavy (marketing focus)
- A&R-heavy (artist acquisition focus)
- CCO-heavy (quality focus)
- Balanced approach

- **Identify pain points**: When do players run out of money? When do choices feel meaningless?
- **Find the fun moments**: When do decisions feel most impactful?
- **Test edge cases**: What if player ignores an executive entirely?

This reveals balance issues and emergent gameplay before any code exists.

## **4. Design the Executive Progression Rewards & Unlock System**

Detail what players actually GET as executives level up:

- **Create unlock trees** for each executive:

- Level 3: New action option unlocked
- Level 5: Reduced costs on all actions
- Level 7: Higher success rates
- Level 10: Legendary action available

- **Design "story moments"** - special events when hitting milestones:

- First time working with executive
- Executive's first major success
- Executive's first major failure
- Executive reaching max level

- **Plan visual feedback** - how do players SEE progression? (badges, titles, UI changes)
- **Create executive-specific achievements** that encourage varied play styles
- **Design the feedback loop** - how does success/failure affect executive mood/loyalty?

This ensures progression feels meaningful and motivating.

## **5. Map Integration Points with Existing Systems**

Document exactly how executives will interact with current game systems:

- **Audit current systems** that executives will touch:

- Artist management (who executives affect)
- Project creation (how executives modify)
- Resource management (what executives consume/generate)
- Random events (how executives interact with)

- **Define data handoffs**:

- What data does MonthPlanner need to pass to executives?
- How do executive effects modify existing project/artist stats?
- Where do executive states get stored?

- **Identify conflicts** with current role system:

- Which role meetings to keep/remove/modify?
- How to handle save game compatibility?
- What happens to existing dialogue content?

- **Create migration plan** from 8 roles to 5 executives
- **Design fallback behaviors** if executive system has issues

This prevents integration surprises and ensures smooth implementation.

## **Why These Five?**

Each addresses a different critical aspect:

1. **Narrative** ensures engaging content
2. **Mechanics** ensures balanced gameplay
3. **Simulation** ensures fun month-to-month flow
4. **Progression** ensures long-term motivation
5. **Integration** ensures technical feasibility

Completing these gives you a **complete design document** that anyone (including yourself in 3 months) could implement without guessing at intentions.
