  Access Tier Unlocks

  Reputation unlocks better industry access across three categories:

  1. Playlist Access (affects streaming reach):

  ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (game-engine.ts lines 1974-1985)
  - None (0+ rep): 0.1x reach multiplier ✅
  - Niche (10+ rep): 0.4x reach multiplier ✅
  - Mid (30+ rep): 0.8x reach multiplier ✅
  - Flagship (60+ rep): 1.5x reach multiplier ✅

  2. Press Access (affects media coverage):

  ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (game-engine.ts lines 1987-1998)
  - None (0+ rep): 5% pickup chance ✅
  - Blogs (8+ rep): 25% pickup chance ✅
  - Mid-tier (25+ rep): 60% pickup chance ✅
  - National (50+ rep): 85% pickup chance ✅

  3. Venue Access (affects touring capacity):
  ⚠️PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (venues defined but tours not fully implemented)
  - None (0+ rep): 0-50 capacity venues ⚠️
  - Clubs (5+ rep): 50-500 capacity venues ⚠️
  - Theaters (20+ rep): 500-2,000 capacity venues ⚠️
  - Arenas (45+ rep): 2,000-20,000 capacity venues ⚠️

  ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED (checked in checkProducerTierUnlocks)
  - Local: 0 reputation (no quality bonus) ✅
  - Regional: 15 reputation (+5 quality bonus) ✅
  - National: 35 reputation (+12 quality bonus) ✅
  - Legendary: 60 reputation (+20 quality bonus) ✅

  Market Impact (from markets.json)

  Reputation affects revenue calculations:
  - Streaming: Reputation weight = 20% of calculation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Tour revenue: +0.3% sell-through per reputation point ✅ IMPLEMENTED (FinancialSystem.ts)
  - Press coverage: +0.8% chance per reputation point ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - Ongoing streams: +0.2% bonus per reputation point ✅ IMPLEMENTED

  Progression Milestones (from progression.json)

  - 10 reputation: Unlock second artist slot ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (no code checks this)
  - 18 reputation: Unlock fourth focus slot ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (deprecated feature)
  - 75 reputation: Achieve global label status ⚠️ PARTIALLY (used in campaign scoring only)

  Difficulty Modifiers

  Reputation decay varies by difficulty:
  ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED - Configured but decay never happens:
  - Easy: 0.5x decay rate
  - Normal: 1.0x decay rate
  - Hard: 1.5x decay rate

  ------------------------------------------------------

  Reputation System Implementation

  Core State Management (schema.ts)

  - Storage: Reputation is stored in gameStates table as an integer (default: 0)
  - Database indexes for efficient reputation lookups

  Game Engine Processing (game-engine.ts)

  1. Reputation Changes

  - Applied through applyEffects() method (line 341-344)
  - Clamped between 0-100
  - Tracked in monthly summary as reputationChanges

  2. Access Tier Updates (lines 1970-2000)

  Updates three access systems based on reputation thresholds:
  - Playlist Access: Affects streaming reach multiplier
  - Press Access: Affects media pickup chances
  - Venue Access: Determines available venue sizes for tours

  3. Producer Tier Unlocks (line 1986)

  Checks if new producer tiers become available as reputation increases

  4. Revenue Calculations

  Reputation directly affects:
  - Streaming revenue: 20% weight in calculation (line 112)
  - Tour revenue: +0.3% sell-through per reputation point
  - Press coverage: +0.8% pickup chance per reputation point
  - Ongoing streams: Reputation bonus factor applied to decay

  5. Release Processing

  - Successful releases with marketing generate reputation gains
  - Press coverage converts to reputation (2x quality/100 multiplier)
  - Tracked per artist in reputationChanges

  Financial System Integration (FinancialSystem.ts)

  Revenue Impact Calculations:

  - Streaming: Reputation component = reputation * 0.20 weight
  - Tour Revenue: Sell-through modified by reputation * 0.003
  - Ongoing Revenue: Reputation bonus = 1 + (reputation - 50) * 0.002
  - Press Coverage: Base chance modified by reputation * 0.008

  API & Routes (routes.ts)

  Campaign Completion Scoring (lines 1487-1498)

  - Reputation contributes to final score: Math.floor(reputation / 5) points
  - Part of victory condition evaluation
  - Stored in campaign results

  Data Validation

  - Reputation included in all game state responses
  - Updated after each month advancement
  - Persisted to database after calculations

  Key Functional Impacts

  1. Progressive Unlocks: Higher reputation unlocks better resources
  2. Revenue Multiplier: Directly scales streaming and tour income
  3. Press Access: Better media coverage chances
  4. Artist Mood: Successful releases boost both reputation and artist mood
  5. Campaign Score: Major component of final game score

  Reputation Flow Through System

  User Actions → Role Meetings/Releases
      ↓
  GameEngine.applyEffects()
      ↓
  Update gameState.reputation (0-100)
      ↓
  Update Access Tiers (playlist/press/venue)
      ↓
  Check Producer Unlocks
      ↓
  Apply to Revenue Calculations
      ↓
  Store in Database
      ↓
  Return in API Response

  Critical Integration Points

  1. Monthly Processing: Reputation affects every revenue calculation
  2. Real-time Updates: Access tiers update immediately when reputation changes
  3. Persistent Effects: Higher reputation provides compounding benefits
  4. Decay Prevention: No automatic reputation decay in current implementation
  5. Artist Association: Reputation changes can be tracked per artist


  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on my thorough code analysis, here are the ONLY reputation gains actually implemented in the game:

  Actually Implemented Reputation Gains

  1. Press Coverage from Releases ✅ WORKING

  Location: game-engine.ts lines 1028-1048

  When you release songs/albums with marketing budget:
  const pressOutcome = this.calculatePressOutcome(
    avgQuality,
    this.gameState.pressAccess || 'none',
    this.gameState.reputation || 0,
    marketingBudget
  );

  // Formula: pickups * (quality/100) * 2
  const reputationGain = pickups > 0 ?
    Math.floor(pickups * (quality / 100) * 2) : 0;

  Example:
  - 3 press pickups with 80 quality song = +4 reputation
  - Requires marketing spend to trigger
  - Higher reputation and better press access = more pickups

  2. Role Meeting Choices ✅ WORKING

  Location: game-engine.ts lines 341-344

  Through dialogue choices with roles (Manager, A&R, etc.):
  case 'reputation':
    this.gameState.reputation = Math.max(0, Math.min(100,
      (this.gameState.reputation || 0) + value));
    summary.reputationChanges.global =
      (summary.reputationChanges.global || 0) + value;

  Example: Meeting choices can give +2, +5, -3 reputation based on the specific choice

  3. Event Choices ✅ POTENTIALLY WORKING

  Side events can theoretically give reputation through the same applyEffects() system, but depends on event data configuration.

  NOT Implemented (Despite Being Configured)

  ❌ Hit Single Bonus (+5 reputation)

  - Configured in balance but no code checks for hit singles

  ❌ Number One Bonus (+10 reputation)

  - Configured in balance but no chart system exists

  ❌ Natural Decay (-0.1 rate)

  - Configured but never applied in monthly processing

  ❌ Goal Failure Penalty (-2 reputation)

  - No goal/objective system implemented

  ❌ Flop Penalty (-3 reputation)

  - No code determines what constitutes a "flop"

  Summary: What Actually Works

  Only 2 reliable ways to gain reputation:

  1. Release music with marketing budget → Press coverage → Reputation
    - Most reliable method
    - Scales with quality, marketing spend, and current reputation
    - Better press access tier = more potential gain
  2. Make good choices in role meetings
    - Variable based on specific dialogue choices
    - Can also lose reputation with bad choices
    - Limited by available meetings

  The Reality:
  - Most of the reputation system from balance.json is not implemented
  - The game primarily uses press coverage as the main reputation mechanic
  - No automatic gains for successful releases (only through press)
  - No chart system, no hit detection, no failure penalties

  This is why reputation growth might feel slow or limited - you're essentially relying on press RNG and dialogue choices, while all the "achievement-based" reputation gains
  don't actually exist in the code.
