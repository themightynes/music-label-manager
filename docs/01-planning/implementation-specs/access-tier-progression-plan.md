## 🎯 **FEATURE OVERVIEW**

The **Access Tier Progression System** provides reputation-based unlocking of industry opportunities across three categories:
- **Playlist Access**: Streaming platform playlists (None → Niche → Mid → Flagship)
- **Press Access**: Media coverage opportunities (None → Blogs → Mid-Tier → National)  
- **Venue Access**: Live performance venues (None → Clubs → Theaters → Arenas)

**Strategic Purpose**: Clear progression goals that gate higher-revenue opportunities behind reputation milestones.

### **ACTUAL GAMEPLAY IMPACT** (Verified September 2025)

#### **Playlist Access - MAJOR REVENUE IMPACT**
- **Directly affects streaming revenue** through `reach_multiplier`:
  - `none`: 0.1x (10% effectiveness) - severe penalty
  - `niche`: 0.4x (40% effectiveness) - 4x improvement over none
  - `mid`: 0.8x (80% effectiveness) - 2x improvement over niche
  - `flagship`: 1.5x (150% effectiveness) - nearly 2x improvement over mid
- **Used in two critical calculations**:
  1. Initial streams (25% weight in formula) - affects first month revenue
  2. Monthly decay bonus - affects long-term revenue sustainability
- **Real Impact**: Songs with flagship access earn **15x more streaming revenue** than with no access

#### **Press Access - MARKETING EFFECTIVENESS**
- **Affects press coverage chance** via `pickup_chance` multipliers
- **Impacts**:
  - Marketing campaign ROI
  - PR push action effectiveness
  - Reputation gains from releases
- **Used in**: `calculatePressPickups()` and `calculatePressOutcome()`

#### **Venue Access - TOUR REVENUE**
- **Determines venue capacity** for tours:
  - `none`: 0-50 capacity (essentially no touring)
  - `clubs`: 50-500 capacity
  - `theaters`: 500-2000 capacity  
  - `arenas`: 2000-20000 capacity
- **Direct revenue impact**: Higher capacity = more ticket sales
- **Used in**: `calculateTourRevenue()` for all tour projects

#### **Campaign Score Bonus - NOW FIXED!**
- Contributes up to 90 points to final campaign score
- Progressive bonuses: 10/20/30 points per tier level
- ✅ FIXED September 2025 - All bonuses now apply correctly

---

## ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### **Issue #1: Tier Name Inconsistency (RESOLVED - August 30, 2025)**

**Problem**: Complete mismatch between data formats across all system layers

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Database Schema** (`/shared/schema.ts` lines 204-206): Updated default values from title case to lowercase
   - Changed "None" → "none" for all three tier fields
2. **GameEngine Comparisons** (`/shared/engine/game-engine.ts` lines 2242-2243, 2303): Fixed tier comparisons to use lowercase
   - Changed 'Mid' → 'mid' and 'Niche' → 'niche' 
   - Changed 'Mid-Tier' → 'mid_tier'
3. **AccessTierBadges Component** (`/client/src/components/AccessTierBadges.tsx` lines 139-163): Added mapping layer
   - Created tierNameMap object to translate between lowercase game state and UI display names
   - Updated getCurrentTier function to handle the mapping
   - Fixed TypeScript null handling

**Approach**: Standardized on lowercase throughout backend with UI mapping layer for display names

**Result**: UI now correctly displays progression and tier upgrades work as intended

### **Issue #2: Missing Upgrade Notifications (RESOLVED - August 30, 2025)**

**Problem**: Silent tier upgrades with no player feedback

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Removed Client-Side Notifications** (`/client/src/components/ToastNotification.tsx` lines 164-165):
   - Removed all access tier upgrade toast notifications
   - Added comment explaining notifications are now server-side
   - Fixed false positive notification on game start by removing problematic comparison

2. **Modified GameEngine.updateAccessTiers()** (`/shared/engine/game-engine.ts` lines 1987-2071):
   - Changed return type from void to GameChange[]
   - Stores previous tier values before updating
   - Generates formatted notifications for tier upgrades with friendly display names
   - Returns array of tier change notifications

3. **Updated advanceMonth()** (`/shared/engine/game-engine.ts` lines 183-184):
   - Collects tier changes from updateAccessTiers()
   - Adds them to summary.changes for display in MonthSummary

**Implementation Approach**: Server-authoritative pattern, consistent with producer tier unlocks. Notifications now appear in the MonthSummary alongside other progression events.

**Notification Format Examples**:
- 🎵 Playlist Access Upgraded: Niche playlists unlocked! Your releases can now reach wider audiences.
- 📰 Press Access Upgraded: Music Blogs coverage unlocked! Your projects will get better media attention.
- 🎭 Venue Access Upgraded: Club Venues unlocked! Your artists can now perform at larger venues.

**Result**: Players now receive clear feedback when unlocking new access tiers through the MonthSummary system

### **Issue #3: Database Default Values Mismatch (RESOLVED - August 30, 2025)**

**Problem**: Database schema defaults used title case while game engine sets lowercase values

**Evidence Found**:
- Schema defaults: Database already had lowercase "none" defaults (fixed previously)
- Client-side game creation: Was sending title case 'None' values when creating new games
- Server-side: Used database defaults correctly
- Result: Initial mismatch between client expectations and actual data

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Database Schema** (`/shared/schema.ts` lines 204-206): Already correct - uses lowercase "none" defaults
2. **Client-Side Game Creation** (`/client/src/store/gameStore.ts` lines 164-166): Fixed title case defaults
   - Changed 'None' → 'none' for all three tier fields
   - Ensures consistency between client and server expectations
3. **Server-Side Game Creation** (`/server/routes.ts` line 202): Relies on correct database defaults

**Impact Resolved**: 
- New games now start with consistent lowercase tier values
- No more initial state mismatches
- UI displays correctly from game creation

**Fix Details**: The issue was that while the database schema had already been fixed to use lowercase defaults, the client-side was still sending title case values when creating new games, causing an initial mismatch.

### **Issue #4: GameData Service Fallback Inconsistency (RESOLVED - August 30, 2025)**

**Problem**: The gameData service had hardcoded fallback values that didn't match the actual tier names

**Evidence Found**:
- `/server/data/gameData.ts` getAccessTiersSync() method had fallback data with:
  - Playlist tiers: Used `"major"` instead of `"flagship"` for highest tier
  - Press tiers: Used `"major"` instead of `"national"` for highest tier
  - Venue tiers: Included `"stadiums"` tier not present in actual configuration
  - Missing `"none"` tier for venue_access

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fallback Data in getAccessTiersSync()** (`/server/data/gameData.ts` lines 448-467):
   - Fixed playlist tier: Changed "major" → "flagship" (line 453)
   - Fixed press tier: Changed "major" → "national" (line 459)
   - Added missing "none" tier for venue_access (line 462)
   - Removed non-existent "stadiums" tier from venue_access

2. **Async Method getAccessTiers()** (`/server/data/gameData.ts` lines 265-336):
   - Fixed playlist tier: Changed "major" → "flagship" (line 285)
   - Fixed press tier: Changed "major" → "national" (line 307)
   - Added missing "none" tier for venue_access (lines 314-318)
   - Removed hardcoded "stadiums" tier that didn't exist in config

**Impact Resolved**:
- Fallback data now exactly matches the actual tier names from the balance configuration
- Ensures consistent behavior even if the balance data fails to load
- Eliminates potential for undefined behavior in fallback scenarios

**Result**: The gameData service now provides consistent tier names whether using live balance data or fallback values

## ❌ **UNRESOLVED ISSUES** (Discovered September 2025)

### **Issue #5: Score Calculation Uses Wrong Tier Names (RESOLVED - September 2025)**

**Problem**: The `calculateAccessTierBonus()` method in game-engine.ts used incorrect tier name comparisons

**Solution Implemented** (`/shared/engine/game-engine.ts` lines 2392-2411):
```typescript
// FIXED CODE - Now includes all tiers with progressive bonuses:
// Playlist: niche=10, mid=20, flagship=30
// Press: blogs=10, mid_tier=20, national=30  
// Venue: clubs=10, theaters=20, arenas=30

if (this.gameState.playlistAccess === 'flagship') bonus += 30;
else if (this.gameState.playlistAccess === 'mid') bonus += 20;
else if (this.gameState.playlistAccess === 'niche') bonus += 10;

if (this.gameState.pressAccess === 'national') bonus += 30;
else if (this.gameState.pressAccess === 'mid_tier') bonus += 20;
else if (this.gameState.pressAccess === 'blogs') bonus += 10;

if (this.gameState.venueAccess === 'arenas') bonus += 30;
else if (this.gameState.venueAccess === 'theaters') bonus += 20;
else if (this.gameState.venueAccess === 'clubs') bonus += 10;
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ All tier bonuses now apply correctly
- ✅ Added missing higher tier bonuses (flagship/national/arenas = 30 points each)
- ✅ Players can now earn up to 90 points from access tier progression
- ✅ Fixed scoring makes endgame more rewarding for progression

### **Issue #6: AccessTierBadges Component Shows Wrong Thresholds (RESOLVED - September 2025)**

**Problem**: The UI component had hardcoded incorrect reputation thresholds

**Evidence** (`/client/src/components/AccessTierBadges.tsx` lines 180-184):

| Tier | Component Shows | Actual Config | Error |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Playlist** | | | |
| Niche | 15 | 10 | +50% wrong |
| Mid | 35 | 30 | +17% wrong |
| Flagship | 60 | 60 | ✅ Correct |
| **Press** | | | |
| Blogs | 10 | 8 | +25% wrong |
| Mid-Tier | 30 | 25 | +20% wrong |
| National | 55 | 50 | +10% wrong |
| **Venue** | | | |
| Clubs | 20 | 5 | +300% wrong! |
| Theaters | 40 | 20 | +100% wrong |
| Arenas | 65 | 45 | +44% wrong |

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Updated all reputation thresholds to match actual config values
- ✅ Fixed venue capacities to match actual ranges  
- ✅ Progress bars now show correct advancement percentages
- ✅ Thresholds now match when tiers actually unlock

### **Issue #7: AccessTierBadges Shows Non-Existent Requirements (RESOLVED - September 2025)**

**Problem**: Component displayed requirements that weren't actually enforced

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Kept non-implemented requirements as **strikethrough text** for future development reference
- ✅ Players can now clearly see what's required (normal text) vs future considerations (strikethrough)
- ✅ Preserves design intentions while preventing player confusion
- ✅ Examples of strikethrough future requirements:
  - ~~1 released project~~ for Niche playlist
  - ~~3 released projects~~ for Mid playlist  
  - ~~5 released projects, Major label status~~ for Flagship
  - ~~Active artist roster~~, ~~Proven live draw~~, etc. for venue tiers

**Result**: Clear visual distinction between active requirements and future development ideas

## ✅ **PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED ISSUES**

**Status**: Issues #1-4 have been resolved as documented below.

**Final Implementation Notes**:
- All tier naming inconsistencies have been resolved across the entire system
- Tier upgrade notifications are working through the MonthSummary system
- Database defaults are properly aligned with game engine expectations
- GameData service fallback values now match actual configuration exactly

**System Status**: 100% COMPLETE and ready for production use.

## 🔧 **DETAILED REMEDIATION PLAN**

### **Fix #1: Standardize Tier Naming Convention (COMPLETED)**

**Implemented Approach**: Use lowercase throughout backend with UI mapping layer

**Changes Completed**:
1. **Database Schema**: Updated default values in schema to lowercase
2. **UI Component Update**: Modified AccessTierBadges.tsx with mapping layer for display names
3. **GameEngine Logic**: Fixed tier comparisons to use lowercase consistently

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// 1. Update schema defaults
playlistAccess: text("playlist_access").default("none"),
pressAccess: text("press_access").default("none"), 
venueAccess: text("venue_access").default("none"),

// 2. Fix GameEngine tier comparisons (game-engine.ts lines 2242-2243, 2303)
// Change from:
if (this.gameState.playlistAccess === 'Mid') bonus += 20;
else if (this.gameState.playlistAccess === 'Niche') bonus += 10;
// To:
if (this.gameState.playlistAccess === 'mid') bonus += 20;
else if (this.gameState.playlistAccess === 'niche') bonus += 10;

// 3. Update AccessTierBadges.tsx getCurrentTier method
const tierNameMap = {
  // Playlist tiers
  'none': 'None',
  'niche': 'Niche',
  'mid': 'Mid',
  'flagship': 'Flagship',
  // Press tiers  
  'blogs': 'Blogs',
  'mid_tier': 'Mid-Tier',
  'national': 'Major',
  // Venue tiers
  'clubs': 'Clubs',
  'theaters': 'Theaters',
  'arenas': 'Arenas'
};

const getCurrentTier = (tierType: keyof typeof accessTiers) => {
  const currentTierName = tierType === 'playlist' ? gameState.playlistAccess :
                         tierType === 'press' ? gameState.pressAccess :
                         gameState.venueAccess;
  
  // Map lowercase tier names from gameState to UI tier names
  const mappedName = tierNameMap[currentTierName] || 'None';
  return accessTiers[tierType].tiers.find(t => t.name === mappedName) || accessTiers[tierType].tiers[0];
};
```

### **Fix #2: Add Tier Upgrade Notifications (COMPLETED)**

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - August 30, 2025

**Implementation Completed**:
1. Modified `GameEngine.updateAccessTiers()` to return `GameChange[]` instead of `void`
2. Added tier change detection by storing previous values before updates
3. Generated formatted notifications with friendly display names for each tier type
4. Updated `advanceMonth()` to collect and add tier changes to `summary.changes`
5. Removed client-side toast notifications to follow server-authoritative pattern

**Files Modified**:
- `/shared/engine/game-engine.ts` lines 1987-2071 (updateAccessTiers method)
- `/shared/engine/game-engine.ts` lines 183-184 (advanceMonth integration)
- `/client/src/components/ToastNotification.tsx` lines 164-165 (removed client notifications)

**Result**: Tier upgrade notifications now appear in MonthSummary alongside other progression events

### **Fix #3: Fix Database Default Values (COMPLETED - August 30, 2025)**

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Issue was client-side game creation sending title case values

**Changes Implemented**:
1. **Database Schema**: Already correct - defaults use lowercase "none" for all three tier fields
2. **Client-Side Fix**: Updated `/client/src/store/gameStore.ts` to send lowercase tier values during game creation
3. **Server-Side**: Correctly relies on database defaults

**Result**: New games now start with consistent lowercase tier values matching the rest of the system

### **Fix #4: Align GameData Service Fallback Values (COMPLETED - August 30, 2025)**

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - GameData service fallback values now match actual configuration

**Solution Implemented**: Updated the fallback data in gameData.ts to match actual configuration:
```typescript
// In /server/data/gameData.ts getAccessTiersSync() method
// Updated fallback to match actual tier names:
playlist_access: {
  // Changed "major" to "flagship"
  flagship: { threshold: 60, reach_multiplier: 1.5, description: "Major playlist access" }
},
press_access: {
  // Changed "major" to "national"
  national: { threshold: 60, exposure_multiplier: 2.0, description: "National media coverage" }
},
venue_access: {
  // Added "none" tier
  none: { threshold: 0, capacity_range: [0, 50], description: "No venue access" },
  // Removed "stadiums" tier (not in actual config)
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/server/data/gameData.ts` lines 448-467 (getAccessTiersSync fallback data)
- `/server/data/gameData.ts` lines 265-336 (getAccessTiers async method)

**Result**: Fallback data now exactly matches actual tier names, ensuring consistent behavior in all scenarios

---

## 📋 **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Manual Testing Scenarios**
1. **Progression Testing**: 
   - Start new game (rep 5), verify shows "none" tier
   - Use console to set reputation to 10, advance month, verify "niche" playlist
   - Set reputation to 30, advance month, verify "mid" playlist + "blogs" press
   - Set reputation to 60, advance month, verify "flagship" playlist
   
2. **Notification Testing**: 
   - Advance month when crossing tier thresholds
   - Verify upgrade messages appear in month summary
   - Check that multiple simultaneous upgrades generate multiple notifications
   
3. **UI Testing**: 
   - Verify AccessTierBadges correctly shows current tier after fixes
   - Check progress bars calculate correctly to next tier
   - Ensure tier names display properly in UI
   
4. **Game Logic Testing**:
   - Verify streaming calculations use correct tier multipliers
   - Test that marketing effectiveness changes with tier upgrades
   - Confirm project quality bonuses apply correctly

### **Automated Testing**
```typescript
describe('Access Tier Progression', () => {
  test('upgrades playlist access at reputation thresholds', () => {
    // Test rep 0→9 = none, 10→29 = niche, 30→59 = mid, 60+ = flagship
  });
  
  test('generates upgrade notifications', () => {
    // Verify MonthSummary.changes includes tier upgrade entries
  });
});
```

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURAL DISCOVERY: MODULAR BALANCE SYSTEM**

### **Key Finding**
The balance configuration has been refactored from a monolithic `/data/balance.json` file to a modular system:
- **Main Aggregator**: `/data/balance.ts` imports and exports all balance modules
- **Modular JSON Files**: `/data/balance/*.json` contain specific configuration domains
- **Backward Compatibility**: The aggregator reconstructs the original balance.json structure

### **Impact on Documentation**
Many existing documentation files reference the old `balance.json` structure. A comprehensive documentation audit is needed to:
1. Update all file path references to the new modular structure
2. Verify that documented line numbers still align with actual files
3. Update architecture diagrams to reflect the modular balance system

### **Files Requiring Documentation Updates** (33 files found referencing balance.json)
- Multiple architecture documents
- Implementation specifications  
- Development roadmaps
- Legacy documentation

*Revised August 30, 2025 after discovering modular balance system architecture.*
