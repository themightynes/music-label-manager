## 🎵 **Real-World Song Lifecycle Patterns**

### **Industry Analysis: Three Distinct Patterns**

#### **1. Flash in the Pan (70% of releases)**
- **Characteristics**: High initial marketing, moderate quality, narrow demographic appeal
- **Pattern**: Spike weeks 1-2 → Rapid decline → Dead by week 8
- **Real Examples**: Viral TikTok songs, novelty hits, trend-following releases
- **Root Cause**: Marketing creates initial buzz but no sustained cultural penetration
- **Game Outcome**: Standard decay progression with minimal catalog value

#### **2. Steady Catalog Builders (25% of releases)**
- **Characteristics**: Good quality, strategic marketing, broad appeal
- **Pattern**: Moderate start → Sustained performance → Slow natural decline
- **Real Examples**: Radio favorites, playlist staples, solid album tracks
- **Root Cause**: Quality + awareness creates lasting value beyond marketing spike
- **Game Outcome**: Enhanced longevity due to cultural awareness

#### **3. Cultural Breakthroughs (5% of releases)**
- **Characteristics**: High quality + strategic timing + cultural moment + luck
- **Pattern**: Growing streams weeks 3-8 → Extended plateau → Slow decline
- **Real Examples**: "Old Town Road", "Blinding Lights", "Bohemian Rhapsody"
- **Root Cause**: Cultural awareness breakthrough creates self-sustaining momentum
- **Game Outcome**: Sustained/growing streams, major long-term revenue

## 📊 **AWARENESS Metric System Design**

### **Core Concept Definition**
**Awareness** = Cultural penetration beyond immediate marketing reach
- **Scale**: 0-100 (0 = Unknown, 100 = Cultural phenomenon)
- **Song-Specific**: Each song builds individual cultural momentum
- **Distinct from Artist Popularity**: Song cultural impact vs artist recognition
- **Persistent**: Awareness accumulates and decays over time, stored per song

### **Awareness vs Existing Metrics**

| Metric | Purpose | Affects | Duration | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Artist Popularity** | Industry recognition | All future releases | Permanent | Taylor Swift = high popularity |
| **Marketing Impact** | Immediate promotion | Weeks 1-4 streams | Temporary | $10k campaign = 4-week boost |
| **Song Awareness** | Cultural penetration | Long-term streams | Sustained | "Bohemian Rhapsody" = enduring awareness |

---

## 🔄 **Three-Phase Awareness Lifecycle**

### **Phase 1: Launch Awareness Building (Weeks 1-4)**

**Marketing Channels → Awareness Contribution:**
```typescript
weeklyAwarenessGain =
  (radioBudget × 0.1 +           // Broad reach, low cultural impact
   digitalBudget × 0.2 +         // Targeted efficiency, moderate impact
   prBudget × 0.4 +              // Industry credibility, high cultural impact
   influencerBudget × 0.3)       // Social momentum, strong cultural impact
  × (songQuality / 100)          // Quality multiplier (poor songs can't build awareness)
  × (1 + artistPopularity / 200) // Popularity helps but isn't dominant
```

**Strategic Implications:**
- **PR and Influencer** become more valuable for long-term catalog building
- **Quality Investment** justifies itself through awareness building potential
- **Marketing Mix** matters more than total budget for sustained impact

### **Phase 2: Breakthrough Potential (Weeks 3-6)**

#### **Breakthrough Thresholds (Quality-Based):**
- **Quality 80+**: 40 awareness needed (high quality carries the song)
- **Quality 70-79**: 60 awareness needed (achievable with good marketing)
- **Quality 60-69**: 80 awareness needed (difficult, requires massive marketing)
- **Quality <60**: No breakthrough possible (quality floor for cultural impact)

#### **Breakthrough Success Probability:**
```typescript
breakthroughChance =
  baseSuccessRate[qualityTier]
  × (1 + artistPopularity / 100)    // Star power helps breakthrough
  × (awareness / thresholdNeeded)   // Awareness over threshold improves odds
  × randomFactor(0.5-1.5)           // "Lightning in a bottle" variance
```

**Base Success Rates:**
- **High Quality (80+)**: 65% base chance
- **Medium Quality (70-79)**: 35% base chance
- **Low Quality (60-69)**: 15% base chance

#### **Breakthrough Effects:**
- **Awareness Explosion**: Current awareness × 2.5 (becomes cultural phenomenon)
- **Stream Growth**: 20-40% increase for 4 weeks instead of decay
- **Extended Longevity**: Slower decay rate (0.92 instead of 0.85)
- **Cross-Demographic Appeal**: Appeals beyond core audience for sustained performance

### **Phase 3: Cultural Longevity (Week 7+)**

#### **Awareness → Streaming Modifier:**
```typescript
awarenessImpactFactor = {
  weeks_1_2: 0.1,    // Minimal impact, marketing still dominant
  weeks_3_6: 0.3,    // Awareness building, potential breakthrough
  weeks_7_plus: 0.5  // Awareness becomes primary sustaining factor
}

awarenessModifier = 1.0 + (currentAwareness / 100) × awarenessImpactFactor[phase]
weeklyStreams = baseDecayStreams × awarenessModifier
```

**Examples:**
- **Week 8, 80 awareness**: 1.4x streams (40% boost from cultural staying power)
- **Week 12, 60 awareness**: 1.3x streams (30% boost from moderate cultural impact)
- **Week 16, 30 awareness**: 1.15x streams (15% boost from residual awareness)

#### **Awareness Decay:**
- **Standard Songs**: -5% awareness per week (cultural attention fades)
- **Breakthrough Songs**: -3% awareness per week (cultural staying power)
- **Quality Bonus**: Songs 85+ quality lose 1% less decay per week (timeless quality)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Specification**

### **Database Schema Changes**

#### **Songs Table Additions:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN awareness INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN breakthrough_achieved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN peak_awareness INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE songs ADD COLUMN awareness_decay_rate DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.05;

-- Indexes for awareness-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_songs_awareness ON songs(awareness) WHERE awareness > 0;
CREATE INDEX idx_songs_breakthrough ON songs(breakthrough_achieved) WHERE breakthrough_achieved = true;
```

### **Phase 1: Minimal Viable Implementation**

#### **1. Awareness Building Integration**
**Location**: `FinancialSystem.ts` - Add awareness calculation to marketing factor method

```typescript
// Add to calculateMarketingFactor() method
private async calculateAwarenessGain(song: any, marketingBreakdown: any): Promise<number> {
  const quality = song.quality || 50;
  const artistPopularity = 0; // TODO: Get from artist data

  // Channel-specific awareness building
  const radioAwareness = (marketingBreakdown.radio || 0) / 10000 * 0.1;
  const digitalAwareness = (marketingBreakdown.digital || 0) / 8000 * 0.2;
  const prAwareness = (marketingBreakdown.pr || 0) / 6000 * 0.4;
  const influencerAwareness = (marketingBreakdown.influencer || 0) / 5000 * 0.3;

  const totalAwarenessGain =
    (radioAwareness + digitalAwareness + prAwareness + influencerAwareness)
    * (quality / 100)
    * (1 + artistPopularity / 200);

  return Math.min(totalAwarenessGain * 100, 25); // Cap at 25 points per week
}
```

#### **2. Awareness → Streaming Modifier**
**Location**: `FinancialSystem.ts:944` - Enhance decay calculation

```typescript
// Add after marketing factor calculation
let weeklyStreams = initialStreams * baseDecay * reputationBonus * accessBonus * ongoingFactor;

// Apply marketing factor (weeks 2-4)
if (weeksSinceRelease >= 2 && weeksSinceRelease <= 4 && song?.releaseId) {
  const marketingFactor = await this.calculateMarketingFactor(song, weeksSinceRelease);
  weeklyStreams *= marketingFactor;
}

// Apply awareness modifier (week 5+)
if (weeksSinceRelease >= 5 && song?.awareness > 0) {
  const awarenessModifier = 1.0 + (song.awareness / 100) * 0.4; // Up to 40% boost
  weeklyStreams *= awarenessModifier;
}
```

#### **3. Weekly Awareness Processing**
**Location**: `game-engine.ts` - Add to song revenue processing

```typescript
// Update song awareness during weekly processing
if (weeksSinceRelease <= 4) {
  // Build awareness from marketing (weeks 1-4)
  const awarenessGain = await this.calculateAwarenessGain(song, marketingBreakdown);
  song.awareness = Math.min((song.awareness || 0) + awarenessGain, 100);
} else {
  // Decay awareness over time (week 5+)
  const decayRate = song.breakthrough_achieved ? 0.03 : 0.05;
  song.awareness = Math.max((song.awareness || 0) * (1 - decayRate), 0);
}
```

### **Phase 2: Future Enhancement - Breakthrough Mechanics**

#### **Breakthrough Check (Weeks 3-6):**
```typescript
private async checkBreakthroughPotential(song: any, weeksSinceRelease: number): Promise<boolean> {
  if (song.breakthrough_achieved || weeksSinceRelease < 3 || weeksSinceRelease > 6) {
    return false;
  }

  const quality = song.quality || 50;
  const awareness = song.awareness || 0;
  const artistPopularity = 0; // TODO: Get from artist data

  // Quality-based thresholds
  const thresholds = {
    high: { minQuality: 80, awarenessNeeded: 40, baseChance: 0.65 },
    medium: { minQuality: 70, awarenessNeeded: 60, baseChance: 0.35 },
    low: { minQuality: 60, awarenessNeeded: 80, baseChance: 0.15 }
  };

  const tier = quality >= 80 ? 'high' : quality >= 70 ? 'medium' : 'low';
  const threshold = thresholds[tier];

  if (quality < threshold.minQuality || awareness < threshold.awarenessNeeded) {
    return false;
  }

  // Calculate breakthrough probability
  const breakthroughChance =
    threshold.baseChance
    * (1 + artistPopularity / 100)
    * (awareness / threshold.awarenessNeeded)
    * (0.5 + Math.random()); // Random factor 0.5-1.5

  return Math.random() < breakthroughChance;
}
```

### **Integration Points**
