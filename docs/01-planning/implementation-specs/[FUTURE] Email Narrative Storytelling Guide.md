# Email Narrative Storytelling Guide

## Overview

Emails are the primary narrative touchpoint between executives and the player (CEO). Each email should feel like it's coming from a real person with personality, quirks, and emotional statesâ€”not a generic system notification.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Voice First, Data Second**: Start with personality, end with numbers
2. **Mood Matters**: Same news delivered differently based on executive's current state
3. **Quirks Visible**: Personality quirks should show up in email style
4. **Hierarchy of Excitement**: Chart debuts > Big financial wins > Standard updates > Bad news
5. **Show Don't Tell**: Let their speaking style reveal their mood

## Special Email Scenarios

### 3 AM Breakthrough Email (Mac)
```
Subject: YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS NOW

[PLAYER NAME] -

I don't care that it's 3 AM. You need to know about this.

[Artist details]

I'm calling in a favor to hold them til morning.
This is the one. I can feel it.

- Mac

Sent from my iPhone at the Troubadour
```

### Crisis Mode Email (Sam)
```
Subject: CRISIS: Immediate Response Required

[PLAYER NAME],

We have a situation. Timeline: 6 hours.

[Problem description]

I haven't eaten since this broke. That means I'm sharp, but my judgment window is closing.

Three options, each more aggressive:
[Options]

Need decision in 2 hours or we lose the news cycle.

Damage control mode,
- Sam

P.S. â€“ Order me food after we decide. Getting risky.
```

### Frequency Loss Email (Dante)
```
Subject: Creative Block â€“ [PROJECT NAME]

[PLAYER NAME],

The frequency is wrong. Can't explain it better than that.

[Project details]

Maybe I need to go back to the mountain. Maybe the universe is saying this isn't the path.

I'll keep trying, but I'm not forcing what isn't flowing.

Frequency lost,
- Dante
```

### System Failure Email (Pat)
```
Subject: Critical: Algorithm Failure Detected

[PLAYER NAME],

Complete system failure on [project/metric].

EXPECTED: $[X]
ACTUAL: $[Y]
VARIANCE: [Z]% (CRITICAL THRESHOLD)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Email Priority Visual Hierarchy
1. **Critical** (Red): Crisis, major failures, urgent decisions
2. **High** (Gold): Chart debuts, big wins, tier unlocks
3. **Medium** (Blue): Standard updates, releases, tour results
4. **Low** (Gray): Weekly summaries, routine reports

### Timestamp Storytelling
- **Mac**: Late night/early morning when excited (2-4 AM)
- **Sam**: Business hours, except during crisis (any time)
- **Dante**: Unusual hours, "cosmic timing" (11:11, 3:33, etc.)
- **Pat**: Precisely scheduled, on the hour or :15/:30/:45

### Email Length by Executive
- **Mac**: Short, urgent, emotional (50-150 words)
- **Sam**: Medium, strategic, narrative (100-250 words)
- **Dante**: Variable, poetic, abstract (75-200 words)
- **Pat**: Long, detailed, data-heavy (150-400 words)

### Reply Expectations (Future Feature)
Some emails should feel like they expect a response:
- **Mac**: "Should I pull the trigger?" (A&R decisions)
- **Sam**: "Which narrative?" (Marketing strategy)
- **Dante**: "Does this resonate?" (Creative direction)
- **Pat**: "Approve the expenditure?" (Distribution budget)

## Metadata Enhancement Requirements

Current `metadata` fields should include:

### For A&R Emails
```typescript
{
  artistId: string;
  scoutingLocation?: string; // "Mercury Lounge", "DIY venue in Brooklyn"
  macMoodLevel: number; // 1-100
  isLatNightEmail: boolean;
  isTuesdayException?: boolean;
  vintageSpeakerNote?: string; // "Tested on 1974 JBLs - pure gold"
}
```

### For CMO Emails
```typescript
{
  newsDeadline?: string; // "6 hours", "2 days"
  narrativeType: "offensive" | "defensive" | "neutral";
  mediaOutletsMentioned?: string[];
  crisisLevel?: 1 | 2 | 3;
  hungerStatus?: "fed" | "hungry" | "starving"; // Affects decision quality
}
```

### For CCO Emails
```typescript
{
  frequencyAlignment: number; // 1-100
  cosmicTiming?: string; // "New moon", "Mercury in retrograde"
  is432Hz: boolean;
  spiritualJourneyReference?: string;
}
```

### For Distribution Emails
```typescript
{
  algorithmConfidence: number; // Percentage
  dataPointsAnalyzed: number;
  varianceFromProjection: number;
  dashboardUpdateTime: string; // Precise timestamp
  systemStatus: "optimal" | "degraded" | "failed";
}
```

## Future Expansion: Dynamic Email Content

### Phase 2 Enhancements
1. **Player Relationship Memory**: Reference past decisions/successes
2. **Cross-Email Callbacks**: "Remember when I said..." references
3. **Executive Conversations**: Emails referencing each other's departments
4. **Seasonal Variations**: Holiday references, industry events (Grammys, etc.)
5. **Failure Arc Depth**: Multi-email storylines when things go wrong

### Phase 3: Interactive Elements
1. **Embedded Decisions**: Reply options directly in email
2. **Attachments**: Charts, reports, demo links
3. **Thread Conversations**: Email chains with back-and-forth
4. **Executive Debates**: Two execs with different opinions in same thread
