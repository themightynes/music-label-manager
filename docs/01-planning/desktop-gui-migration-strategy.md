## üéÆ Core Architecture Decisions

### **1. Rendering & UI Layer (BIGGEST DECISION)**

Your current setup uses **React DOM rendering**. Desktop GUI paths available:

#### **Tauri** (recommended for you)
- Wraps your React app in native OS windows
- Shares your existing Vite/React stack
- Minimal code changes required
- Produces lightweight native executables
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

#### **Electron**
- More established ecosystem
- Heavier bundle size
- Larger memory footprint
- Mature tooling and community support

#### **Game Engine** (Godot, Unreal, custom)
- Complete rewrite required
- True desktop game feel
- Significant timeline investment
- Abandoned existing React/TypeScript stack

#### **Hybrid Approach** (Tauri + Canvas/Three.js)
- React for UI/menus
- Game engine for core gameplay visualization
- Best of both worlds (complexity)

**Recommendation for Music Label Manager**: **Tauri** is ideal because you retain 95% of existing React code, just swap web deployment for desktop bundling.

---

### **2. Backend Dependency (CRITICAL)**

Your game currently requires:

- **Railway PostgreSQL** for all game state
- **Express server** for game logic and calculations
- **Clerk authentication** for user management

#### **Key Questions to Answer**

1. **Do you want desktop to work offline?**
   - Yes ‚Üí Requires significant backend refactor
   - No ‚Üí Easy Tauri wrapper approach

2. **Can players lose access if server goes down?**
   - Current model: Yes (server dependency)
   - Alternative: Local-first with optional sync

3. **Single-player only, or multiplayer/competitive?**
   - Single-player ‚Üí Can go fully local
   - Multiplayer ‚Üí Need cloud sync architecture

#### **Implementation Options**

**Option A: Keep Cloud-Dependent** (Easiest)
- Desktop becomes Tauri wrapper of current web app
- All game logic stays server-side
- Players authenticate via Clerk on desktop
- Requires active internet connection
- Minimal code changes: ~10-15% effort

**Option B: Local-First Hybrid** (Medium)
- Ship SQLite database locally on desktop
- Sync to PostgreSQL server when online
- Graceful offline mode with eventual consistency
- Optional cloud save system
- Moderate refactor: ~40-50% effort

**Option C: Fully Offline** (Hardest)
- Move entire GameEngine to client-side (it can be!)
- No server dependency for gameplay
- Local SQLite for all saves
- Optional cloud export/import
- Significant refactor: ~60-80% effort

---

### **3. Game Engine Location (STRATEGIC)**

Currently: **GameEngine lives in `/shared/engine/`** (portable between client and server)

This is **actually GOOD** for desktop transition because:

- ‚úÖ Can run on both client and server without modification
- ‚úÖ Financial calculations (FinancialSystem) are already modular
- ‚úÖ State machines (XState) are framework-agnostic
- ‚úÖ No tight coupling to Express/database layer

#### **Desktop Implications**

If targeting **offline play**:
- Move GameEngine entirely client-side (minor refactoring)
- Remove server dependency from game calculations
- Use `/shared/types` for state validation (Zod already in place)
- Maintain deterministic RNG for consistent gameplay

If targeting **cloud-dependent**:
- GameEngine stays server-side
- Desktop UI becomes thin client
- No changes needed to core logic

**Current Architecture**: Already optimized for this transition! This is a major advantage.

---

### **4. Asset & Content System**

Your current `/data/` JSON structure is **design-forward**, not asset-forward:

- ‚úÖ Text-based content (artist names, songs, dialogue)
- ‚úÖ Modular balance system (economy.json, progression.json, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Configuration-driven gameplay
- ‚ùå No sprite sheets, textures, or 3D models
- ‚ùå No audio assets (background music, sound effects)
- ‚ùå Limited visual animation

#### **Desktop GUI Needs**

- **Visual Polish**: UI mockups, icon sets, album art rendering
- **Audio Design**: Background music, UI sound effects (currently missing)
- **Animations**: Smoother transitions than Motion.dev alone
- **Responsive Layout**: Desktop-sized viewports vs. responsive web

#### **Important Note**

This is a **design/art debt**, not an architecture problem. Your systems can handle visual upgrades without code refactoring. Content structure is ready for enhanced assets.

## üîß Technical Migration Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Validation (1 week)**

Before committing to architecture, validate key assumptions:

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test building current React app with Tauri
- [ ] Test offline play with local SQLite + in-memory GameEngine
- [ ] Profile current server dependencies (list actual bottlenecks)
- [ ] Measure PostgreSQL vs. SQLite performance locally
- [ ] Test Clerk authentication on desktop app
- [ ] Identify hot paths that must stay server-side

**Deliverable**: Decision document with proof-of-concept code

---

### **Phase 2: Architecture Decision (2 weeks)**

Based on Phase 1 results, formally choose one path:

**Option A: Cloud-Dependent Desktop** (60% effort, quick path)
- Tauri wrapper of existing web app
- All game logic server-side
- New deployment pipeline (Windows/Mac/Linux builds)
- Clerk authentication persists
- Users need internet connection

**Option B: Local-First with Cloud Sync** (120% effort, balanced path)
- GameEngine partially refactored for client
- SQLite local saves by default
- Optional PostgreSQL sync for cloud saves
- Hybrid Clerk + local accounts
- Works offline, syncs when online

**Option C: Complete Offline Desktop** (250% effort, premium path)
- Full GameEngine migration to client
- No backend dependency for gameplay
- SQLite only for local saves
- Optional cloud export/import (backup system)
- Zero server calls for core gameplay

---

### **Phase 3: Incremental Migration** (depends on chosen option)

Each option requires different implementation order. Document will be updated with phase-specific tasks based on decision.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current State Pain Points

Based on your existing architecture, here's what will be HARD:

### **1. Clerk Authentication (Medium Pain)**

**Problem**: Works great for web, awkward for desktop offline play

**Current State**: Clerk metadata for admin roles, browser-based sign-up/login

**Options**:
- Keep Clerk for online mode, add local account fallback
- Create desktop-specific auth system with Clerk as optional sync
- Store JWT locally for offline validation

**Effort**: 20-30% of backend refactor

---

### **2. TypeScript + Vite + React (Low Pain)**

**Problem**: Adds complexity to desktop build pipeline

**Current State**: Hot reload, tree-shaking, optimized bundling

**Benefits**: 
- Tauri integrates seamlessly with Vite
- Motion.dev animations work on desktop
- TypeScript strictness provides safety

**Effort**: 5-10% (Tauri handles this elegantly)

---

### **3. Weekly Turn-Based Model (NO PAIN)**

**Problem**: None identified

**Current State**: One action per week, turn queuing, deterministic progression

**Benefits**:
- Perfect for desktop (no real-time pressure)
- No network latency issues
- Offline play is natural fit

**Effort**: 0% (actually helps migration)

---

### **4. PostgreSQL Dependency (HIGH PAIN)**

**Problem**: Heavy for single-player desktop game

**Current State**: All game state in Railway PostgreSQL, Express API layer required

**Options**:
- SQLite locally for desktop, PostgreSQL only for cloud saves
- Migrate GameEngine to client, eliminate need for persistent server
- Hybrid: Local SQLite with PostgreSQL sync on demand

**Effort**: 40-60% of backend refactor (depends on option chosen)

---

### **5. XState Machines (NO PAIN)**

**Problem**: None identified

**Current State**: A&R Office machine, Artist Dialogue machine

**Benefits**:
- Framework-agnostic (works in Tauri as-is)
- Fully portable to client-side
- State visualization tools work on desktop

**Effort**: 0% (will work unchanged)

---
