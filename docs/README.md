## üéØ Quick Start for New Developers

### **Understanding the System (30 minutes)**
1. Read [System Architecture](./02-architecture/system-architecture.md) for the big picture
2. Review [Complete User Workflows](./03-workflows/user-workflows.md) to understand user experience
3. Check [Game Mechanics](./03-workflows/game-mechanics.md) for core game logic

### **Setting Up Development (15 minutes)**
1. Follow [Development Setup](./06-development/setup.md) guide
2. Run the application locally using instructions in the setup guide
3. Play through a complete 12-month campaign to understand the game

### **Making Your First Changes (1 hour)**
1. Review [Frontend Architecture](./04-frontend/frontend-architecture.md) to understand UI patterns
2. Look at [Database Design](./02-architecture/database-design.md) for data structure
3. Study existing components in `/client/src/components/` for code patterns

## üìû Support & Questions

## üîç Key Files to Understand First

### **Core Game Logic**
- `/shared/engine/game-engine.ts` - All game calculations and logic
- `/shared/schema.ts` - Database schema and type definitions
- `/data/balance.json` - Economic balance and game formulas

### **Main UI Components**
- `/client/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Main game interface
- `/client/src/components/MonthPlanner.tsx` - Turn-based action system
- `/client/src/components/DialogueModal.tsx` - Role conversation system

### **Backend Core**
- `/server/routes.ts` - All API endpoints and business logic
- `/server/storage.ts` - Database operations and data access
- `/server/data/gameData.ts` - Content loading and management

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Development Tasks

### **Content Modifications**
- **Adding new dialogue**: Edit `/data/roles.json` or `/data/dialogue.json`
- **Modifying game balance**: Update `/data/balance.json`
- **Adding new artists**: Edit `/data/artists.json`

### **Code Changes**
- **Creating new UI components**: Follow patterns in `/client/src/components/`
- **Adding new API endpoints**: Extend `/server/routes.ts` with proper validation
- **Modifying game logic**: Update `/shared/engine/game-engine.ts`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions Made

- **Unified Game Engine**: All calculations happen in one place for consistency
- **JSON-based Content**: Easy for non-developers to modify game content
- **Component-based UI**: Reusable components with clear responsibilities
