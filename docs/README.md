## üìã **Documentation Best Practices**

### **üéØ Folder Purpose Guidelines**

**Before adding documentation, ask:**
1. **Does this content belong in an existing folder?**
2. **Does this create redundancy with existing docs?**
3. **Is this the right audience for this folder?**

### **üìÅ Folder Boundaries**

| Folder | Purpose | Audience | What Goes Here | What Doesn't Go Here |
|--------|---------|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| `01-planning/` | Strategic vision & roadmaps | PMs, Leadership | Business requirements, roadmaps | Implementation details, code |
| `02-architecture/` | System design & schemas | Developers | Technical architecture, data schemas | User guides, implementation steps |
| `03-workflows/` | Process flows | Developers, PMs | User journeys, system processes | Code examples, debugging |
| `04-frontend/` | React app architecture | Frontend devs | Component design, UI patterns | Backend details, content editing |
| `05-backend/` | Server implementation | Backend devs | Server setup, API implementation | Architecture theory, user guides |
| `06-development/` | Practical dev guides | All developers | Setup guides, how-to content | Architectural theory, future plans |
| `08-future-features/` | Roadmap & ideas | PMs, Developers | Future enhancements, research | Current implementation, user guides |
| `09-troubleshooting/` | Problem solving | All roles | Debugging, fixes, known issues | General documentation, tutorials |

### **üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

1. **Content Duplication**: If it exists elsewhere, link to it instead
2. **Wrong Audience**: Don't put technical details in user-facing docs
3. **Scope Creep**: Keep folder purposes narrow and distinct
4. **Future Bloat**: Don't document unimplemented features in current docs

### **‚úÖ Documentation Review Checklist**

**Before adding new documentation:**
- [ ] **Unique Value**: Does this provide information not available elsewhere?
- [ ] **Right Location**: Does this match the folder's purpose and audience?
- [ ] **Cross-References**: Are links to related docs included?
- [ ] **Maintenance**: Will this stay current with code changes?
- [ ] **Clarity**: Can the target audience understand and act on this?

**Before editing existing documentation:**
- [ ] **Scope Check**: Are you changing the document's intended purpose?
- [ ] **Consistency**: Does this match the style and depth of the folder?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Will this break links in other documents?

### **üîÑ Maintenance Guidelines**

1. **Link Validation**: Check that all internal links work when moving/renaming files
2. **Audience Consistency**: Don't mix technical and non-technical content in the same document
3. **Length Control**: Split documents over 500 lines into focused sub-documents
4. **Regular Review**: Remove outdated information rather than letting it accumulate

### **üìù Adding New Content**

**Step 1**: Determine if new content is needed
- Search existing docs for similar information
- Consider updating existing docs instead of creating new ones

**Step 2**: Choose the right location
- Match content purpose to folder purpose
- Consider the primary audience who will use this content
- Avoid creating new folders unless absolutely necessary

**Step 3**: Write with focus
- Address one specific need or question
- Link to related information rather than duplicating it
- Use the minimum viable documentation approach
