## üö® **CRITICAL SESSION RULES (Updated)**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Background Process Management**
**NEVER start background processes without explicit user permission!**

```bash
# ‚ùå COMMON MISTAKE (causes port conflicts):
npm run dev --run_in_background=true  # DON'T DO THIS during reviews!

# ‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:
# For code reviews/analysis: Use Read, Glob, Grep, npm run check only
# For development: Ask "Should I start the dev server?" first
# Always clean up: Kill any background processes at session end
```

### **üìã Session Types & Appropriate Tools**

**1. Strategic Planning/Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Read planning docs (`01-planning/`)
- ‚úÖ Read implementation docs (`02-07/`)
- ‚úÖ Use static analysis tools only
- ‚ùå No background servers needed

**2. Codebase Review/Technical Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Read, Glob, Grep, npm run check
- ‚úÖ Examine architecture documentation
- ‚ùå No background servers unless explicitly requested

**3. Active Development:**
- ‚úÖ Ask permission: "Should I start the dev server for testing?"
- ‚úÖ Edit, Write, MultiEdit for implementation
- ‚úÖ Use development documentation as reference

**4. Testing/Debugging:**
- ‚úÖ Background processes OK with user permission
- ‚úÖ Always clean up processes at session end
