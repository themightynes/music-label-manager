## 🚀 AI-Assisted Feature Development

For structured feature development, use **ai-dev-tasks** workflow:

1. `@ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md` - Define feature scope
2. `@ai-dev-tasks/generate-tasks.md` - Break into tasks
3. `@ai-dev-tasks/process-task-list.md` - Implement iteratively

See `@ai-dev-tasks/README.md` for full details.
