- **Timeline**: 2 months (planning ‚Üí production ‚Üí marketing ‚Üí released)
- **Revenue Potential**: $5,000-$25,000 based on quality and marketing
- **Streaming Formula**:
  ```typescript
  const streams = (quality * 0.8) + (playlistAccess * 100) + (reputation * 0.5) + (marketingSpend * 0.3);
  const revenue = streams * 0.003; // $0.003 per stream
  ```

#### **EP Release**
- **Budget**: $15,000-$35,000
- **Timeline**: 4 months
- **Revenue Potential**: $20,000-$80,000
- **Quality Bonus**: +25% base quality due to expanded content

#### **Mini-Tour**
- **Budget**: $5,000-$15,000
- **Timeline**: 1 month
- **Revenue Calculation**:
  ```typescript
  const venueCapacity = getVenueCapacity(venueAccess); // 100-300 for clubs
  const sellThrough = 0.6 + (reputation * 0.01) + (artistPopularity * 0.005);
  const ticketPrice = 25 + (venueCapacity * 0.05);
  const revenue = venueCapacity * sellThrough * ticketPrice * numberOfCities;
  ```

### **Project Progression**
Projects automatically advance through stages each month:

```typescript
const stages = ['planning', 'production', 'marketing', 'released'];

// Progression logic (in GameEngine)
if (monthsElapsed >= 1 && stage === 'planning') stage = 'production';
if (monthsElapsed >= 2 && stage === 'production') stage = 'marketing';  
if (monthsElapsed >= 3 && stage === 'marketing') stage = 'released';

// Quality increases each stage
quality = Math.min(100, quality + 25);
```

### **Project Success Factors**
- **Artist Talent**: Base multiplier for all calculations
- **Budget Investment**: Higher budgets improve quality and marketing reach
- **Label Reputation**: Affects playlist placement and press coverage
- **Access Tiers**: Multiplicative bonuses to reach and success rates

## ‚öñÔ∏è Game Balance System

### **Economic Balance**
All economic calculations are driven by `/data/balance.json`:

```json
{
  "starting_resources": {
    "money": 75000,
    "reputation": 5,
    "creative_capital": 10,
    "focus_slots": 3
  },
  "monthly_costs": {
    "base_operational": [3000, 6000],
    "artist_monthly": [800, 1500],
    "project_overhead": 0.1
  },
  "project_costs": {
    "single": { "min": 3000, "max": 12000 },
    "ep": { "min": 15000, "max": 35000 },
    "mini_tour": { "min": 5000, "max": 15000 }
  },
  "revenue_formulas": {
    "streaming": {
      "base_streams_per_point": 1000,
      "quality_weight": 0.8,
      "playlist_weight": 1.0,
      "reputation_weight": 0.5,
      "revenue_per_stream": 0.003
    }
  }
}
```

### **RNG System**
Deterministic randomness using seeded random number generation:

```typescript
// Seed format: gameId-currentMonth ensures consistent outcomes
const seed = `${gameState.id}-${gameState.currentMonth}`;
const rng = seedrandom(seed);

// All random calculations use this seeded RNG
const variance = rng() * 0.2 + 0.9; // 90%-110% variance
const outcome = baseValue * variance;
```

### **Progression Gates**
Key unlocks tied to reputation milestones:

```typescript
const progressionGates = {
  second_artist_slot: 25,      // reputation
  fourth_focus_slot: 50,       // reputation  
  playlist_niche_access: 15,   // reputation
  playlist_mid_access: 50,     // reputation
  press_blog_access: 25,       // reputation
  press_mid_access: 60,        // reputation
  venue_club_access: 40        // reputation
};
```

## üéØ Campaign Completion & Scoring

### **Campaign Structure**
- **Duration**: 12 months exactly
- **Goal**: Build successful music label and achieve high score
- **End Trigger**: Automatic completion when advancing from month 12

### **Scoring System**
Final score calculated from multiple factors:

```typescript
const scoreBreakdown = {
  money: Math.floor(finalMoney / 1000),           // 1 point per $1k
  reputation: Math.floor(finalReputation / 5),    // 1 point per 5 reputation
  artistsSuccessful: countSuccessfulArtists(),    // Based on artist metrics
  projectsCompleted: countCompletedProjects(),    // Based on project outcomes
  accessTierBonus: calculateAccessTierBonus()    // Bonus for tier progression
};

const finalScore = Object.values(scoreBreakdown).reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0);
```

### **Victory Types**
Determined by score distribution and final state:

- **Commercial Success**: High money score, moderate reputation
- **Critical Acclaim**: High reputation score, moderate money  
- **Balanced Growth**: Even distribution across metrics
- **Survival**: Completed campaign with minimal success
- **Failure**: Negative money or very low overall score

### **Achievements System**
Dynamic achievements based on performance:

```typescript
const achievements = [];

if (finalMoney >= 100000) achievements.push('üí∞ Big Money - Ended with $100k+');
if (finalReputation >= 200) achievements.push('‚≠ê Industry Legend - 200+ Reputation');
if (playlistAccess === 'Mid') achievements.push('üéµ Playlist Master - Maximum playlist access');
if (finalMoney >= 0) achievements.push('üõ°Ô∏è Survivor - Made it through 12 months');
```

---

## üîÑ Advanced Mechanics

### **Delayed Effects System**
Actions can have consequences that trigger in future months:

```typescript
// Store delayed effect in game flags
const delayedEffect = {
  triggerMonth: currentMonth + 2,
  effects: { money: 3000, reputation: 5 },
  description: "Magazine feature boost"
};

gameState.flags[`delayed_${choiceId}`] = delayedEffect;

// Process delayed effects each month
const triggeredEffects = Object.values(gameState.flags)
  .filter(effect => effect.triggerMonth === currentMonth);
```

### **Artist Relationship Dynamics**
Artist mood and loyalty affect project outcomes:

```typescript
// Project quality modified by artist mood
const moodMultiplier = 0.8 + (artistMood / 100) * 0.4; // 80%-120%
const finalQuality = baseQuality * moodMultiplier;

// Loyalty affects contract renewal likelihood (future feature)
const renewalChance = 0.5 + (artistLoyalty / 100) * 0.5; // 50%-100%
```

### **Market Dynamics**
Access tiers create multiplicative benefits:

```typescript
// Playlist placement calculation
const baseReach = 1000;
const playlistMultiplier = accessTiers.playlist[currentTier].reach_multiplier;
const finalReach = baseReach * playlistMultiplier * qualityFactor;

// Press pickup calculation  
const baseChance = 0.05;
const accessChance = accessTiers.press[currentTier].pickup_chance;
const finalChance = baseChance + accessChance + (reputation * 0.01);
```

---

## üé≤ Random Events (Future Feature)

### **Event System Framework**
Random events add variability and narrative to campaigns:

```typescript
interface GameEvent {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  trigger_chance: number;
  requirements?: {
    min_reputation?: number;
    required_artists?: number;
  };
  effects: {
    immediate?: ResourceEffects;
    delayed?: DelayedEffect[];
  };
}
```

### **Event Categories**
- **Industry Events**: Award shows, festival opportunities, label competitions
- **Artist Events**: Creative breakthroughs, personal challenges, collaboration offers
- **Market Events**: Streaming platform changes, industry trends, economic shifts
- **Random Events**: Unexpected opportunities, technical issues, viral moments
