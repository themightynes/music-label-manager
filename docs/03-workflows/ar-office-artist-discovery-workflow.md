# A&R Office Artist Discovery Workflow

**Status**: âœ… Complete Implementation (September 28, 2025)
**Component**: A&R Office Artist Scouting System
**Integration**: Focus Slots, Executive Meetings, Week Advancement

## ðŸŽ¯ **System Overview**

The A&R Office provides a dedicated artist discovery system that replaces the previous "all artists available from start" model with a strategic scouting workflow. Players must allocate Focus Slots to discover new artists through three different sourcing approaches, with the Head of A&R becoming unavailable for meetings during active operations.

## ðŸ”„ **Complete User Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Accessing A&R Office**
1. **Navigation**: Player clicks "A&R Office" from the Game Sidebar
2. **Page Load**: A&R Office page displays with Marcus Rodriguez executive avatar
3. **Status Check**: System displays current Focus Slot availability and any active operations

### **Phase 2: Selecting Sourcing Mode**
Player chooses from three sourcing approaches:

#### **ðŸš€ Active Scouting**
- **Description**: Dedicate focus to actively scout the scene
- **Benefits**: Unlocks higher-quality discoveries and detailed insights
- **Cost**: 1 Focus Slot
- **Duration**: Completes after week advancement

#### **ðŸ§­ Passive Browsing**
- **Description**: Browse the standard discovery pool
- **Benefits**: Standard artist discovery with normal quality distribution
- **Cost**: 1 Focus Slot
- **Duration**: Completes after week advancement

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Specialized Search**
- **Description**: Target specific genres, venues, or platforms
- **Benefits**: Find niche talent with specialized characteristics
- **Cost**: 1 Focus Slot
- **Duration**: Completes after week advancement

### **Phase 3: Operation Activation**
1. **Validation**: System checks for available Focus Slots (must have â‰¥1 available)
2. **Slot Consumption**: Selected mode consumes 1 Focus Slot immediately
3. **Executive Status**: Head of A&R becomes "busy" and unavailable for meetings
4. **Operation Tracking**: System begins tracking operation start time and sourcing type
5. **UI Update**: A&R Office shows "Sourcing operation in progress" status

### **Phase 4: Executive Meeting Impact**
- **Head of A&R Unavailability**: During active A&R operations, Head of A&R shows "A&R Busy" status
- **Meeting Prevention**: Executive card becomes disabled with "Sourcing Active" badge
- **Focus Slot Attribution**: Executive Meetings display shows slot allocation (e.g., "Exec: 2 â€¢ A&R: 1 â€¢ Avail: 0")
- **Operation Details**: Executive card shows sourcing type and start time

### **Phase 5: Week Advancement Processing**
1. **Automatic Completion**: When player advances week, A&R operation completes automatically
2. **Artist Selection**: Game Engine selects random unsigned artist from pool
3. **Discovery Logic**: Filters out already signed artists and previously discovered artists
4. **Quality Variation**: Artist quality/potential varies based on sourcing mode selected
5. **Slot Release**: Focus Slot is freed for next week's use
6. **Data Persistence**: Discovered artist stored in game state flags

### **Phase 6: Artist Discovery Results**
1. **Week Summary**: Week advancement summary shows "A&R sourcing (mode) completed. Discovered [Artist Name]."
2. **Results Loading**: A&R Office automatically loads discovered artists after operation completion
3. **Artist Display**: Discovered artists appear in searchable/filterable table
4. **Artist Information**: Each artist shows name, archetype, talent, popularity, genre, signing cost

### **Phase 7: Artist Evaluation & Signing**
1. **Artist Browser**: Player can search by name/genre and filter by archetype
2. **Signing Decision**: Player reviews artist stats and signing cost
3. **Budget Validation**: System checks if player has sufficient funds for signing cost
4. **Signing Process**: Player clicks "Sign" to recruit artist to roster
5. **Cost Deduction**: Signing cost deducted from label budget
6. **Roster Integration**: Signed artist moves to main Artist Roster
7. **Discovery Cleanup**: Artist removed from discovered artists pool

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Workflow Details**

### **State Machine Management**
- **XState Integration**: A&R operations managed by `arOfficeMachine.ts`
- **State Tracking**: Machine tracks `idle`, `sourcingActive`, and `noSlotsAvailable` states
- **Focus Slot Reservation**: Local optimistic reservation prevents double-booking
- **Server Synchronization**: Real-time sync between client state and server A&R status

### **API Endpoints Used**
- `POST /api/game/:gameId/ar-office/start` - Initiate sourcing operation
- `POST /api/game/:gameId/ar-office/cancel` - Cancel active operation
- `GET /api/game/:gameId/ar-office/status` - Check operation status
- `GET /api/game/:gameId/ar-office/artists` - Load discovered artists

### **Game Engine Integration**
- **Weekly Processing**: `processAROfficeWeekly()` method in GameEngine
- **Artist Pool Management**: Filters signed and previously discovered artists
- **Discovery Persistence**: Artists stored in `gameState.flags.ar_office_discovered_artists` array
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing save games

## ðŸŽ® **Player Strategy Considerations**

### **Resource Management**
- **Focus Slot Allocation**: Players must balance A&R scouting vs Executive meetings
- **Timing Strategy**: When to scout based on current roster needs and available slots
- **Budget Planning**: Manage signing costs alongside other weekly expenses

### **Sourcing Mode Strategy**
- **Active Scouting**: Higher risk/reward for discovering exceptional talent
- **Passive Browsing**: Consistent results for building roster depth
- **Specialized Search**: Targeted discovery for specific genre needs

### **Executive Coordination**
- **A&R vs Meetings**: Cannot use Head of A&R for meetings during scouting operations
- **Weekly Planning**: Consider A&R operations when planning executive interactions
- **Slot Optimization**: Balance between discovery and management activities

## ðŸ”„ **Error Handling & Edge Cases**

### **Insufficient Focus Slots**
- **Prevention**: UI disables sourcing modes when no slots available
- **Recovery**: "Retry" option appears after slot becomes available
- **Clear Messaging**: "No focus slots available" with helpful guidance

### **Operation Cancellation**
- **Manual Cancel**: Player can cancel active operations early
- **Slot Recovery**: Cancelled operations immediately free Focus Slot
- **Data Preservation**: Previously discovered artists retained on cancellation

### **Artist Pool Depletion**
- **Graceful Degradation**: System handles case where all artists signed/discovered
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback when no new artists available
- **Fallback Logic**: Maintains operation completion even with empty results

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics & Feedback**

### **Visual Indicators**
- **Progress Status**: Real-time operation progress with sourcing type display
- **Slot Attribution**: Clear breakdown of Focus Slot usage across systems
- **Executive Status**: Visual "busy" indicators for unavailable executives
- **Discovery Count**: Running total of discovered vs signed artists

### **Player Feedback**
- **Week Summaries**: Clear reporting of scouting outcomes in weekly results
- **Cost Transparency**: Upfront signing costs before commitment
- **Quality Indicators**: Artist stats visible before signing decisions
- **Discovery History**: Track of all previously discovered artists

## ðŸŽ¯ **Business Value Delivered**

### **Strategic Depth**
- **Resource Constraints**: Focus Slots create meaningful trade-offs
- **Discovery Variety**: Three sourcing modes provide strategic choice
- **Executive Integration**: Realistic constraint where A&R activities impact management

### **Player Engagement**
- **Active Discovery**: Players actively hunt for talent vs passive availability
- **Decision Weight**: Scouting requires resource investment and planning
- **Collection Gameplay**: Building roster through strategic discovery operations

### **System Integration**
- **Seamless Flow**: Integrates perfectly with existing Focus Slot and Executive systems
- **Week Advancement**: Natural completion timing aligns with game progression
- **Save Compatibility**: Works with all existing game saves without disruption
