## üí∞ Budget Per Song Strategy

### **Understanding Budget Efficiency**

Your budget per song affects quality through efficiency breakpoints:

```
Under-funded (< 50% of minimum):    -5 quality penalty
Minimal Budget (50-75% of minimum):  0 quality bonus  
Adequate Budget (75-100% minimum):   +3 quality bonus
Strong Budget (100-150% minimum):    +7 quality bonus
Over-funded (> 150% minimum):        +5 quality bonus (diminishing returns)
```

### **Minimum Viable Costs by Project Type**
- **Single**: $2,500 per song
- **EP**: $3,000 per song  
- **Mini-Tour**: $5,000 per song

### **Strategic Budget Examples**

#### **Budget Scenario 1: Quality Focus**
- **Budget**: $4,500 per song (150% of EP minimum)
- **Quality Bonus**: +7 (maximum efficiency)
- **Strategy**: High-quality singles with strong streaming potential
- **ROI**: Best quality-to-cost ratio

#### **Budget Scenario 2: Volume Strategy**  
- **Budget**: $2,250 per song (75% of EP minimum)
- **Quality Bonus**: +3 (adequate quality)
- **Strategy**: More projects with reasonable quality

#### **Budget Scenario 3: Premium Investment**
- **Budget**: $6,000 per song (200% of EP minimum)
- **Quality Bonus**: +5 (diminishing returns)
- **Strategy**: Occasional premium releases

  artistMoodBonus +       // Artist happiness (0-20)
  producerBonus +         // Producer tier (0-20)
  timeBonus +             // Time investment (-10 to +15)  
  budgetBonus +           // Budget efficiency (-5 to +7)
  songCountImpact         // Multi-song penalty (0.85-1.0x)

## üìà Expected Returns (UPDATED: Configuration-Driven)

### **Quality vs. Revenue Correlation**
**CRITICAL UPDATE**: All revenue calculations now use balance.json configuration:  
- **Revenue per stream**: `ongoing_streams.revenue_per_stream: 0.05` (NOT 0.003)  
- **Monthly decay rate**: `monthly_decay_rate: 0.85` (15% loss per month)  

```
// Individual Song Revenue (using balance.json configuration)
Quality 40-50: $2,000-6,000 initial + ongoing monthly revenue with 15% decay
Quality 50-60: $6,000-12,000 initial + ongoing monthly revenue with 15% decay
Quality 60-70: $12,000-20,000 initial + ongoing monthly revenue with 15% decay
Quality 70-80: $20,000-32,000 initial + ongoing monthly revenue with 15% decay
Quality 80-90: $32,000-50,000 initial + ongoing monthly revenue with 15% decay
Quality 90-100: $50,000+ initial + ongoing monthly revenue with 15% decay
```

### **ROI Optimization Formula (UPDATED: Configuration-Driven)**
```typescript
// ALL calculations use balance.json via getStreamingConfigSync()
const streamingConfig = getStreamingConfigSync();
const revenuePerStream = streamingConfig.revenue_per_stream; // 0.05
const decayRate = streamingConfig.monthly_decay_rate; // 0.85

// Individual Song Revenue Calculation
const initialStreams = songQuality * 50 * (1 + qualityBonus);
const initialRevenue = initialStreams * 0.5; // Initial release bonus

// Monthly Ongoing Revenue (15% decay)
const monthlyDecay = Math.pow(decayRate, monthsSinceRelease);
const ongoingRevenue = initialStreams * monthlyDecay * revenuePerStream;

// Regional Producer Example (using actual balance.json values):
const qualityBonus = 5; // +5 quality from regional producer
const costMultiplier = 1.8; // 1.8x cost increase
expectedROI = (qualityBonus * expectedStreams * 0.05) / costMultiplier;
```
