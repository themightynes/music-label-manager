## üí∞ Budget Per Song Strategy

### **Understanding Budget Efficiency**

Your budget per song affects quality through efficiency breakpoints:

```
Under-funded (< 50% of minimum):    -5 quality penalty
Minimal Budget (50-75% of minimum):  0 quality bonus  
Adequate Budget (75-100% minimum):   +3 quality bonus
Strong Budget (100-150% minimum):    +7 quality bonus
Over-funded (> 150% minimum):        +5 quality bonus (diminishing returns)
```

### **Minimum Viable Costs by Project Type**
- **Single**: $2,500 per song
- **EP**: $3,000 per song  
- **Mini-Tour**: $5,000 per song

### **Strategic Budget Examples**

#### **Budget Scenario 2: Volume Strategy**
