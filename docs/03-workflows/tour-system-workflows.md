## ‚öôÔ∏è **System Workflow: Tour Processing**

### **Tour Lifecycle States**

1. **Planning** - Tour is booked but not yet started
2. **Production** - Tour is in progress, cities being completed
3. **Recorded/Complete** - All cities completed successfully
4. **Cancelled** - Tour terminated early (60% refund)

### **Month Advancement Processing**

```
User advances month with tour in "planning" stage
    ‚Üì
GameEngine processes tour project
    ‚Üì
Tour moves to "production" stage
    ‚Üì
City performance is calculated:
    ‚Ä¢ Venue capacity determined by access tier
    ‚Ä¢ Sell-through rate calculated:
        - Base rate (15%)
        - Reputation bonus (5% per point)
        - Artist popularity bonus
        - Marketing quality bonus
    ‚Ä¢ Ticket revenue = capacity √ó sell-through √ó ticket_price
    ‚Ä¢ Merch revenue = ticket_revenue √ó 15%
    ‚Ä¢ Costs = venue_fee + production_fee + marketing_budget
    ‚Ä¢ Net profit = total_revenue - total_costs
    ‚Üì
City results stored in project.metadata.tourStats
    ‚Üì
If all cities complete: tour moves to "recorded" stage
    ‚Üì
Frontend displays updated tour progress
```

### **Tour Cancellation Workflow**

```
User clicks "Cancel" on active tour
    ‚Üì
Cancellation modal shows breakdown:
    ‚Ä¢ Original cost
    ‚Ä¢ Cities completed vs planned
    ‚Ä¢ Sunk costs (non-refundable)
    ‚Ä¢ Refund amount (60% of remaining cities)
    ‚Üì
User confirms cancellation
    ‚Üì
useGameStore.cancelProject() called
    ‚Üì
DELETE /api/projects/{projectId}/cancel
    ‚Üì
Server calculates refund and updates game money
    ‚Üì
Tour removed from active list
    ‚Üì
Money returned to player account
```

## üí∞ **Financial Calculation Workflow**

### **Revenue Calculation**
```
Base Formula: venue_capacity √ó sell_through_rate √ó ticket_price

Ticket Price Calculation:
    base_price (25) + (capacity √ó 0.03)

Sell-Through Rate Calculation:
    base_rate (0.15)
    + reputation_bonus (reputation √ó 0.05)
    + popularity_bonus (artist.popularity √ó weight)
    + marketing_bonus (budget_quality √ó factor)

Merchandise Revenue:
    ticket_revenue √ó 0.15
```

### **Cost Calculation**
```
Venue Fees:
    capacity √ó venue_tier_multiplier

Production Fees:
    base_production_cost + capacity_scaling

Marketing Costs:
    user_defined_budget_per_city

Total Costs Per City:
    venue_fee + production_fee + marketing_cost

Total Tour Cost:
    (costs_per_city √ó cities) + overhead
```

## üìä **Analytics & Reporting Workflow**

### **Active Tours Display**
```
Tour shows in "Active Tours" tab
    ‚Üì
Progress bar indicates completion percentage
    ‚Üì
Tour budget and current stage displayed
    ‚Üì
[Production stage] Completed cities shown:
    ‚Ä¢ City number and venue name
    ‚Ä¢ Attendance and revenue
    ‚Ä¢ Real-time profit tracking
```

### **Completed Tours Display**
```
Tour moves to "Completed Tours" tab
    ‚Üì
CompletedToursTable renders sortable data:
    ‚Ä¢ City-by-city performance table
    ‚Ä¢ Venue names and capacities
    ‚Ä¢ Attendance rates and revenue
    ‚Ä¢ Cost breakdowns and profit
    ‚Ä¢ ROI calculations
    ‚Üì

## üéØ **Strategic Decision Points**

### **Venue Capacity Selection**
- **Low Risk**: Smaller venues with higher sell-through rates
- **Medium Risk**: Moderate venues balancing capacity and fill rate
- **High Risk**: Large venues with potential for big profits or losses

### **Marketing Budget Allocation**
- **Minimal Budget**: Lower costs but reduced sell-through rates
- **Moderate Budget**: Balanced approach with decent marketing impact
- **Heavy Budget**: Maximum marketing impact but higher risk

### **Tour Length Decisions**
- **Single Shows**: Lower risk, immediate results, limited upside
- **Mini Tours**: Higher investment, economies of scale, greater profit potential

---

## üîß **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Performance Optimizations**
- 500ms debounced API calls for estimation
- Client-side state caching for tour data
- Efficient table rendering for large tour datasets

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation for missing tour data
- Fallback calculations for incomplete city information
- Validation at API boundary for all inputs

### **Data Consistency**
- Server-side calculations ensure consistent results
- Transaction safety for tour creation and cancellation
- Real-time state synchronization between client and server

---

## üéµ **Integration with Game Systems**

### **Artist Relationship Impact**
- Successful tours improve artist mood and loyalty
- Failed tours (low attendance) negatively impact relationships
- Tour frequency affects artist availability and satisfaction

### **Reputation System Integration**
- Tour success/failure affects label reputation
- Reputation influences future tour sell-through rates
- Regional reputation affects tour performance in different markets

### **Venue Access Progression**
- Better venue access unlocks larger capacity venues
- Access tiers determine available capacity ranges:
  - None: 0-50 capacity
  - Clubs: 50-500 capacity
  - Theaters: 500-2000 capacity
  - Arenas: 2000-10000 capacity
